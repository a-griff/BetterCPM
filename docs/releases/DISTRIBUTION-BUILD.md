# Building the current BetterCP/M System Disks

The authoritative [manifest in progress](DISTRIBUTION-MANIFEST.md) selects disk
membership. `metadata/distribution.json` records its System Disk projection,
implementation status, target applicability, and user area. PIP and WHEREIS are
selected System Disk utilities; TED is on the primary Utilities Disk.
This builder does not assemble Utilities or the separate CP/M Tools Disk.

Both System Disks include `README.TXT` in user 0. Its authoritative source is
`src/distribution/README.TXT`, ASCII with CR/LF lines and CP/M text EOF. Source
snapshotting and input hashing include it, and normal file-integrity checks
verify the installed contents.

From the repository root:

```sh
python3 tools/build_distribution.py
python3 tools/build_distribution.py --target z80pack
python3 tools/build_distribution.py --target trs80gp
```

The cpmsim target requires the patched emulator described in
[Installing BetterCP/M on z80pack / cpmsim](../platform/CPMSIM-INSTALLATION.md).
Include its source lock, complete patches, builder, instructions and license in
the release; stock upstream cpmsim is insufficient.

Prerequisites are those used by the existing build/qualification tools:
`~/bin/z80asm`, Python 3, cpmtools (`cpmcp`, `cpmls`, `fsck.cpm`), the qualified
cpmsim environment and its helpers, and trs80gp. `--simulator` and `--emulator`
override the existing local default paths. Model 4 launch uses the repository's
LaunchServices wrapper on macOS. The builder actually boots both targets;
there is no filesystem-only shortcut advertised as a boot-qualified release.

Each target is rebuilt from a private source snapshot using existing builders.
The current utility metadata needs common Model 4 artifacts even during a
cpmsim build; prerequisites are built inside that snapshot. Development build
artifacts and disks are untouched. Only freshly assembled system tracks are
retained from intermediate target images; the distribution filesystem starts
empty and receives the exact selected build artifacts. No utility, diagnostic,
or extension is selected by scanning development-disk contents.

The script lives at `tools/build_distribution.py`. After all requested targets
pass validation, it publishes these convenient image names:

- `build/trs80/BetterCPM-Distribution-trs80gp-80T-DS-System.dmk`
- `build/z80pack/disks/library/BetterCPM-Distribution-z80pack-332K.dsk`

These names are distinct from development images. Each named image is replaced
atomically from a checksum-verified temporary copy. Existing successful named
images remain intact when build or validation fails.

The same validated images and full evidence are retained in a new immutable
generation under `build/distribution/`:

- `z80pack/BetterCPM-Distribution-z80pack-332K.dsk`
- `trs80gp/BetterCPM-Distribution-trs80gp-80T-DS-System.dmk`

Each target directory includes `report.json`, the build log, directory listing,
filesystem check output, and boot transcript/screens. The report records source
revision/input hashes, manifest hash, included artifact hashes, target-specific
omissions, planned omissions, allocated/free capacity, tool/emulator hashes,
and validation results. The raw Model 4 intermediate is only a filesystem-tool
representation; the DMK carries the actual Model 4 system and boot tracks.

All requested targets must pass before a generation is published. Earlier
successful generations are never overwritten. Repeating a build with identical
inputs and results reuses the existing generation after verifying its target
reports and image hashes. The fixed-name emulator images are refreshed from
that verified generation, including when a previous emulator run changed them.
An incomplete, damaged, or mismatched existing generation fails verification
and is preserved for inspection; do not delete a release just to repeat a build.
A failed invocation reports the
failed command and leaves previous distributions intact. Choose `--work` to
retain isolated build logs and artifacts on failure:

```sh
python3 tools/build_distribution.py --work /tmp/bettercpm-dist-build
python3 tools/build_distribution.py --work /tmp/bettercpm-dist-build --reuse-work
```

`--reuse-work` accepts only a completed build whose source revision, input
hashes, assembler hash, and every cached artifact hash still match. It does not
select artifacts by timestamp or fall back to an old binary after build failure.
Use a fresh work directory after changing inputs or after an incomplete build.
Use `--output` to choose a separate publication directory.

`BYE` shuts down cpmsim and returns to the host shell. `BYE.COM` is included
only on the cpmsim distribution; it is not a Model 4 utility. The builder
verifies a real simulator exit before publishing that image.

Clock providers are available for explicit loading: `ZPRTC.RSX` on cpmsim and
`FREHDCLK.RSX` on Model 4. FreHD requires the relevant hardware/emulation;
shipping that provider does not make every Model 4 clock-capable. CPX/RSX
management includes its required file-backed runtime helpers. Optional P2DOS
and 104/105 clock adapters and test extensions are not selected. No on-disk
user documentation has been selected yet; host documentation remains here.

These are distributions of the current implemented state. They are not final
1.0 release candidates and do not replace the remaining conformance campaign
or the cpmsim reproducibility requirement.


Distribution cold boot runs `SUBMIT STARTUP`. The selected `STARTUP.SUB` is an
ASCII, CR/LF script with a CP/M EOF marker and initially contains `:VER /BANNER`. The
builder installs it in A0: and writes a checksummed BCST command record using
each platform’s physical record mapping. Development/test image builders retain
their disabled startup default so scripted qualification can choose its own
command. This setting adds no permanent BIOS code and does not reduce the core 53K TPA.

The introductory banner belongs to `VER.COM`. Resident `VER /BANNER` uses the
existing `VER: Use :VER.` feature hint. The script explicitly invokes
`:VER /BANNER`, avoiding dependence on automatic handoff. The banner change
leaves BIOS and BDOS sizes unchanged and preserves the RCP rounded allocation.


### ED integration and cpmsim base media

ED is built by `tools/build_ed.py` as `build/utilities/ED.COM`. The development
alias `build/ed-development/EDDEV.COM` has identical bytes; native ED qualification
checks both against ZSM4/LINK output. The System Disk manifest installs ED on
both targets, and both boot checks execute `ED /VER` from the constructed disk.

For cpmsim, the isolated distribution build requests `--system-tracks-only`
from `tools/build_z80pack_image.py`. This supplies reserved system records and
matching disk definitions without first packing the unrelated development/test
file inventory into the small disk. The distribution builder still creates and
validates the complete filesystem solely from the authoritative manifest.
The ordinary cpmsim development disk keeps its existing test inventory; ED is
installed by isolated ED campaigns and by the distribution builder.

## CONFIG compatibility fingerprint

CONFIG Build 005 replaces the external SYSGEN.DAT reference with embedded
20-byte layout/geometry/CRC-32 records. Neither System Disk needs SYSGEN.DAT.
The ordinary common build generates its Model 4 record from the freshly built
resident image. After assembling its platform resident image, the cpmsim builder
explicitly rebuilds CONFIG with a second record for that image and geometry.
It does not discover records from leftover output directories. Native ZSM4/LINK
uses the same generated `build/utilities/config-validation.inc` as cross assembly.

The distribution gate independently derives the expected record from the actual
installed carrier (including cpmsim sector skew) and requires it exactly once in
CONFIG.COM. A mismatched or missing fingerprint fails before publication.
The checksum's exact normalization and corruption-detection limits are described
in the [CONFIG specification](../engineering/CONFIG%20Specification.md).
