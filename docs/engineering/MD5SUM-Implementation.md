# MD5SUM 1.0 development implementation

Date: 2026-10-28. Implements the design merged in PR #532 and the maintainer's
subsequent implementation authorization. MD5SUM is an implemented development
candidate, integrated in newly generated paired Utilities images. The maintainer has waived and deferred the remaining Model 4 validation for
PR finalization; paired release acceptance is not asserted. The controlling contract
is [MD5SUM-Specification.md](MD5SUM-Specification.md).

## Source and build

MD5SUM has its own executable, algorithm, command dispatch, conventional list
parser, rendering and reference-candidate routines under `src/utilities/md5sum`.
`tools/build_md5sum.py` composes these with labelled routines from CRCKSUM's
command, traversal, reference streaming, transaction and support modules. It
omits CRC-specific selection, native/historical formatting and discovery tiers.
CRCKSUM's executable sources and behavior are unchanged. The test BDOS model is
also shared, selecting its executable through an optional argument.

The input map records the shared source dependencies. Changes to relevant shared
routines must be reviewed for both utilities. The builder assembles the complete
prepared source; an absent routine boundary is a build failure. Corresponding
source includes the composition tool as well as every source fragment. This
avoids maintaining independent copies of the file engine while leaving the two
user interfaces separate.

```sh
python3 tools/build_md5sum.py
python3 tools/test_md5sum.py
python3 tools/build_native_md5sum.py
```

The registry assigns MD5SUM version 1.0, revision 002. Without a qualified
baseline, identification displays `MD5SUM 1.0 (002-dev)`. The current COM is
18,316 bytes, including fixed working storage and a 512-byte private stack. It
loads at 0100h and ends at 488Ch (exclusive). SHA-256:

```text
692a83f1e21911987cdabba8747463a306ac5b46e6d91b7c8bc47d00a5576022
```

MD5 uses a 64-byte block, sixteen-byte state, four-byte step temporary and
64-bit input-bit count. The rotation/index/constants schedule is generated at
build time; the guest does no floating-point work. Update preserves IX, which
is the shared stream's current byte pointer. File/summary accounting remains
32-bit, and each stored logical record contributes all 128 bytes.

The rest of storage is bounded by the existing 127-byte command-tail grammar:
up to 64 operands, 512 DU identities, fixed reference/record buffers and two
output streams. Directory and list replay avoid fixed entry-count arrays.
Sorting and repeated reference scans trade disk operations for bounded memory.
The parser accepts ordinary starred/two-space entries and reports malformed,
unsupported, embedded-NUL/high-bit, invalid-filename and overlong records.
Reference line numbers include malformed physical lines. Input mode markers
never enable target text conversion.

The original revision 001 [qualification summary](MD5SUM-Qualification.json)
binds that earlier campaign to its binary and images. The current prompt-help
increment has separate evidence linked at the end of this document.

## Focused evidence

- 87 compiled command/routine fixtures pass against independent Python hashlib
  results and the hostile BDOS model. They cover RFC examples, split update and
  finalization boundaries, padded/high-bit files, a 65,792-byte stream, bit-length
  carry, queries, command errors, both list entry forms, case/line-ending rules,
  malformed input, duplicate alternatives, missing/unlisted files, local-only
  discovery, 40-column output and simultaneous master/local streams.
- Overwrite Y/N/A, cancellation and injected create/write/close/rename failures
  preserve the old final list. The model clobbers public BDOS scratch registers
  and reuses directory DMA; every command checks caller DU/DMA/stack restoration
  and the untouched bottom stack guard.
- ZSM4/LINK on stock CP/M 2.2 produces a byte-identical COM. Native version/help,
  one-record calculation/list generation and local verification commands pass.
- The packaged BetterCP/M cpmsim campaign runs MD5SUM and ZSM4/LINK from exact
  Utilities B:, builds on disposable C:/D:, and checks native/cross parity. It
  exercises user 31, padded and >64K fixtures, native list generation/checking,
  simultaneous master/local output, a negative digest check and `/40`. Fixture
  bytes and the entire Utilities B: image remain unchanged.
- Host md5sum verifies the exact stored fixture bytes using a two-space/LF
  copy of the conventional list. Only the reference presentation is converted;
  checked target bytes remain unchanged.
- Paired disk construction validates file readback, filesystem integrity and
  the Model 4 DMK/raw round trip. Package tests check MD5SUM's executable/native
  identities, complete corresponding-source closure, pending acceptance and
  refusal of incomplete or mismatched acceptance proofs.
- The reused command harness still passes all 129 CRCKSUM fixtures. Registry
  projections, metadata checks, Python syntax and whitespace checks pass.

Development evidence is written under `build/md5sum-development`:
`HOST-MD5SUM-CHECKS.json`, `NATIVE-MD5SUM-BUILD.LOG` and the packaged campaign's
`evidence.json` and `transcript.txt`. These are development results, not an
assertion that both release platforms passed.

## Candidate disk integration

The collection and Utilities builders include MD5SUM. Prepared native source,
build provenance and a native-build README accompany the shared full source
archive. `--md5sum-acceptance` can bind a separately supplied complete receipt to
the exact executable, native source and paired media; no PASS receipt is created
by the implementation or packaging build.

```sh
python3 tools/build_utilities_disk.py --build --output build/md5sum-utilities-candidate
python3 tools/test_md5sum_distribution.py --package build/md5sum-utilities-candidate
python3 tools/test_md5sum_media.py \
  --image-dir /path/to/BetterCPM/build/z80pack \
  --utilities build/md5sum-utilities-candidate \
  --report build/md5sum-development/packaged-cpmsim
```

The 26-file primary 332K candidate allocates 18K to MD5SUM and has 2K free.
The Model 4 primary uses the existing 800K data format. NOAH remains on its
existing companion volume. Use writable target/workspace disks for lists and
native build products; the primary cpmsim Utilities disk has very little spare
capacity. Further additions require another capacity assessment.

## Deferred Model 4 qualification

On 2026-10-28 the maintainer explicitly waived the remaining Model 4 validation
for now, with the intention to return to it later. This permits PR finalization;
it is not a runtime PASS, a qualified baseline or paired release acceptance.
No acceptance receipt is fabricated. The deferred work includes native linking,
actual console display, large-file processing, local lists and input/state
preservation on that target. Retain the fixtures and launch-failure evidence
below for resumption. This is an explicit MD5SUM waiver, separate from CRCKSUM. A fresh attempt on
2026-10-28 used disposable System A: and exact candidate Utilities B: images.
Both the existing LaunchServices wrapper and opening the original installed app
failed with `kLSNoExecutableErr` (-10827), although its executable exists. Direct
execution exited immediately with SIGABRT (-6), without stdout/stderr or a guest
screen capture. No Model 4 runtime pass or paired release acceptance is claimed.
The failure occurred before guest validation; it does not establish a defect
in MD5SUM. Launch arguments and results are retained under
`build/md5sum-development/model4-fresh-attempt`.

Manual fallback media are prepared under
`build/md5sum-development/manual-model4-001/MD5SUM-Model4-001.zip`: disposable
System/fixture A:, exact Utilities B:, NOAH companion C: and native-source work
disk D:, with README steps and file identities. Startup returns to the normal
prompt. No normal emulator image was replaced or drive ejected. The prepared native source
can be copied as MD5SUM.MAC to a disposable work disk and built with:

```text
B:ZSM4 MD5SUM=MD5SUM
B:LINK MD5SUM[A]
```

A minimal manual one-record check uses the existing A31:FIX.DAT fixture:

```text
B:MD5SUM /VER
B:MD5SUM /HELP
B:MD5SUM A31:FIX.DAT /LOCAL=MD5SUM.LST
B:MD5SUM /CHECK A31:FIX.DAT
B:MD5SUM A31:FIX.DAT /40
```

Expected digest: `b42a83d49df3489b2324811d5ed28d76`. This short check alone
would not complete the full Model 4 campaign. Stack guards are not a physical
interrupt worst-case stack proof; maximum directory sizes and all 512 DUs have
not been exhaustively run on hardware. No qualified baseline, frozen disk
release or whole-disk acceptance is promoted here.

## Inline prompt-help increment

The current revision adds `?` to existing multi-action replacement prompts;
choices and defaults are unchanged. Older broad campaigns above apply to their
recorded artifacts. Current focused/native/packaged evidence is described in
[Utility Prompt Help Qualification](Utility%20Prompt%20Help%20Qualification.md).
The Model 4 validation deferral remains in effect; no new Model 4 PASS is claimed.

MD5SUM's console-row buffer is now 128 bytes; reference text retains its separate
256-byte buffer. The longest generated digest/name row is 46 characters, and
verification diagnostics fit within the console buffer. This avoids spending
another allocation block merely to add help; saved formats are unchanged.
