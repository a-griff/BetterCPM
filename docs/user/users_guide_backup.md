# BetterCP/M 1.0 User's Guide

## Table of Contents

### 1. Introduction

BetterCP/M is a CP/M-compatible operating system for Z80-based computers. It preserves the familiar programming and operating environment of CP/M 2.2 while providing a number of extensions and improvements for modern CP/M systems.

BetterCP/M remains recognizably CP/M. Existing CP/M programs run in the conventional Transient Program Area and use the standard CP/M BDOS and BIOS interfaces. Drives, user areas, file names, command syntax, and the ordinary CP/M programming environment retain their familiar meanings.

At the same time, BetterCP/M extends the system in areas where additional facilities are useful. These include an improved command environment, command history and editing, configurable resident commands, CPX and RSX extensions, expanded disk-format and configuration facilities, and system services not provided by CP/M 2.2.

This manual describes BetterCP/M from the user's point of view: starting and operating the system, working with files and disks, using commands and utilities, configuring the system, and installing and managing extensions.

#### 1.1 What is BetterCP/M?

BetterCP/M is an implementation and extension of the CP/M operating environment rather than a replacement for it with an unrelated system.

Compatibility with CP/M 2.2 is a fundamental part of its design. Programs written for CP/M use the conventional program-entry environment, BDOS interface, file system, File Control Blocks, command tail, and other interfaces expected by CP/M software. BetterCP/M also retains familiar CP/M operating conventions such as drive letters, user areas, transient .COM programs, and warm boot.

BetterCP/M adds facilities beyond the original CP/M 2.2 environment. Some are built into the system, while others are supplied by loadable extensions or transient utilities. These facilities are designed to extend the system without unnecessarily changing the CP/M environment on which existing software depends.

BetterCP/M 1.0 is supplied for two reference environments: the TRS-80 Model 4 environment used with trs80gp, and the Z80 system environment used with z80pack/cpmsim. Platform-specific facilities can differ where the underlying hardware or emulator capabilities differ.

#### 1.2 Starting BetterCP/M

BetterCP/M starts when a prepared BetterCP/M system disk is booted on a supported system.

During a cold boot, the operating system initializes its system state, establishes the configured command environment and extensions, and applies the saved startup configuration. When initialization is complete, BetterCP/M displays its command prompt and is ready to accept commands.

A warm boot returns control to the operating system without performing a complete cold initialization. As in conventional CP/M, programs can terminate by returning through the CP/M warm-boot mechanism. BetterCP/M reconstructs the command environment as necessary and returns to the command prompt while preserving system state that is defined to survive a warm boot.

The distribution disks save `SUBMIT STARTUP` as the cold-start command.
`STARTUP.SUB` in A0: initially runs `:VER /BANNER`, displaying the current system identity.
Edit that script to customize startup. Warm boot does not rerun it. CONFIG can
change or disable the saved startup command; a missing script produces SUBMIT’s
normal error and leaves the command prompt available. There is no standalone
ECHO command in 1.0 at present.

Normal operation begins at the command prompt.

##### 1.2.1 Terminal monitor (planned for 1.0)

The accepted 1.0 design provides a loadable terminal monitor, sometimes called
the TCAP RSX. Implementation is pending. The Model 4 monitor will provide
Montezuma Micro-style ADM-3A behavior; the general terminal target is VT52.
Full-screen programs must be configured for the terminal personality supplied
by the monitor and use the supported console interfaces.

The monitor can be loaded by a startup SUBMIT script using the saved cold-start
command, such as `SUBMIT STARTUP`. Warm boot keeps the monitor loaded and does
not rerun the startup script. Provider filenames and installation instructions
will be supplied when implementation is qualified.

Without the monitor, the basic console remains available for commands and text
output, but does not provide complete terminal emulation. Loading the monitor
reduces memory available to programs. Unloading it releases that memory; with
all RSXs unloaded, the system returns to its 53K core TPA baseline.

#### 1.3 The Command Environment

BetterCP/M is a command-line operating system. The user interacts with and controls the operating system by typing commands at the command prompt.

A command may be provided directly by the command processor, by a resident Command Processor Extension (CPX), or by a transient program loaded from disk. This distinction is normally unimportant when entering a command: the user types the command name followed by any required operands or options.

For example:

```text
DIR
TYPE README.TXT
COPY B:PROGRAM.COM=A:PROGRAM.COM
```

BetterCP/M provides command-line editing and command history in addition to the conventional CP/M command environment. Drives and user areas can also be selected directly from the command line.

Chapter 3 describes the command environment in detail. Individual commands are described beginning in Chapter 4.

#### 1.4 Using This Manual

This manual assumes general familiarity with computers and gives particular attention to the facilities and operating conventions of BetterCP/M. Familiar CP/M concepts are described where necessary for using the system, but elementary computing concepts are not introduced separately.

Chapter 2 describes drives, user areas, file specifications, wildcards, and file attributes. Chapter 3 covers the BetterCP/M command environment, including command-line editing, history, resident and transient commands, and program execution. Chapter 4 provides the basic command reference.

Later chapters cover batch processing, CPX and RSX extensions, system configuration, disk operations, date and time facilities, installation, and troubleshooting.
Programmers who require the BetterCP/M programming interfaces should consult the BetterCP/M Programmer's Guide. Internal system architecture and implementation are covered separately in the BetterCP/M technical documentation.

### 2. Drives, User Areas, and Files
#### 2.1 Drives and User Areas

BetterCP/M follows the standard CP/M convention of identifying disk drives by letters. Drives are named `A:` through `P:`, although the number of drives actually available depends on the system and its configuration.

The current drive is shown as part of the BetterCP/M command prompt. To select another drive, enter its drive letter followed by a colon:

```text
A> B:
B>
```

Files may also be referenced on another drive without changing the current drive:

```text
A>DIR B:
A>TYPE B:README.TXT
```

BetterCP/M also retains the CP/M user-area system. Each drive can contain files in user areas numbered 0 through 15. User areas provide separate logical file spaces on the same disk: a file in one user area is ordinarily distinct from files in the other user areas on that drive.

The current user area can be selected directly by entering its number:

```text
A>5:
A5>
```

A drive and user area can be selected together:

```text
A> B3:
B3>
```

This selects drive B, user area 3.

BetterCP/M uses the term **drive/user**, or **DU**, when referring to a particular combination of drive and user area. Thus `A0:` identifies drive A, user 0; `B3:` identifies drive B, user 3.

A drive/user specification can also qualify a command or file operation without changing the current drive/user. For example:

```text
A>DIR B3:
```

lists the files in user area 3 of drive B while leaving the current drive and user area unchanged.

The ordinary CP/M conventions remain valid. Programs that use the standard BDOS drive and user facilities see the same drive/user organization, and conventional CP/M programs need not be aware of BetterCP/M's combined `DU:` command notation.

#### 2.2 File Names and File Specifications

BetterCP/M uses the standard CP/M file-naming convention. A file name consists of a name of up to eight characters and an optional file type of up to three characters, separated by a period:

```text
filename.typ
```

For example:

```text
README.TXT
STAT.COM
MYPROG.ASM
DATA
```

`README.TXT` has the file name `README` and the file type `TXT`. `DATA` has no file type.

File types commonly indicate the purpose or format of a file. For example, `.COM` normally identifies an executable program, `.ASM` an assembly-language source file, and `.SUB` a SUBMIT command file. These conventions do not change the basic organization of the file; the file type is part of its name.

A **file specification**, or **filespec**, identifies a file and may include a drive and user area:

```text
README.TXT
B:README.TXT
B3:README.TXT
```

If no drive or user area is specified, BetterCP/M uses the current drive and user area. Thus, if the current prompt is:

```text
A2>
```

the file specification:

```text
README.TXT
```

refers to `README.TXT` in drive A, user area 2.

A drive can be specified without a user number:

```text
B:README.TXT
```

and BetterCP/M commands that support DU-qualified file specifications can identify both explicitly:

```text
B3:README.TXT
```

This identifies `README.TXT` on drive B in user area 3 without requiring the current drive/user selection to be changed.

File specifications are used throughout BetterCP/M commands. For example:

```text
TYPE README.TXT
ERA B:OLD.DAT
COPY B3:REPORT.TXT A:REPORT.TXT
```

Many commands also accept **wildcard file specifications**, allowing a single specification to select more than one file. Wildcards are described in the next section.

#### 2.3 Wildcards

Many BetterCP/M commands accept wildcard file specifications when an operation is to apply to more than one file. BetterCP/M uses the standard CP/M wildcard characters `?` and `*`.

A question mark (`?`) matches any single character in the corresponding position of a file name or file type. For example:

```text
DIR TEST?.COM
```

can match files such as:

```text
TEST1.COM
TEST2.COM
TESTA.COM
```

An asterisk (`*`) is a convenient abbreviation for wildcarding the remaining characters in a name or file type. Common examples include:

```text
DIR *.COM
DIR LETTER.*
DIR *.*
```

`*.COM` selects files with the file type `COM`, regardless of file name. `LETTER.*` selects files named `LETTER` with any file type. `*.*` selects all files applicable to the command.

Wildcards can also be used with drive and user-area specifications:

```text
DIR B:*.COM
DIR B3:*.ASM
```

The first searches the applicable user area on drive B for `.COM` files. The second searches user area 3 of drive B for `.ASM` files.

Not every command permits wildcards in every operand. The description of each command states where wildcard file specifications are accepted.

#### 2.4 File Attributes

BetterCP/M supports the standard CP/M **read-only**, **system**, and **archive** file attributes. These attributes are stored with the file's directory information and are preserved by operations that preserve CP/M file attributes.

The **read-only (R/O)** attribute protects a file against ordinary operations that would modify or erase it. BetterCP/M enforces this attribute.

The **system (SYS)** attribute identifies a file as a system file. In BetterCP/M 1.0, the SYS attribute does not make a file visible across user areas; normal drive and user-area rules still apply.

The **archive (ARC)** attribute is available as file metadata. BetterCP/M 1.0 does not assign it an automatic backup policy.

A file can have more than one attribute at the same time.

The system utilities provided with BetterCP/M allow these attributes to be inspected, set, and cleared. The appropriate utility and its syntax are described later in this manual.

File attributes should not be confused with file types. In:

```text
SYSTEM.COM
```

`COM` is the file type. R/O, SYS, and ARC, if present, are attributes associated with the file.

#### 2.5 Changing Media

BetterCP/M supports removable disks and preserves the CP/M rules needed to prevent directory information from one disk from being written inadvertently to another.

Do not remove or replace a disk while an operation is reading from or writing to it. Complete the operation before changing the medium.

When a disk is changed, BetterCP/M detects or responds to the media state according to the capabilities of the drive and platform. A changed disk must be recognized before operations that modify its directory or file allocation are allowed to proceed normally.

As with conventional CP/M, a disk can become temporarily read-only when the operating system cannot safely establish that its current directory information corresponds to the medium in the drive. This protects the new disk from writes based on stale information from the disk it replaced.

If BetterCP/M reports that a disk is read-only following a media change, use the normal disk-reset or warm-boot procedure appropriate to the operation before attempting further writes. Do not treat a read-only indication following an unexpected media change as permission to force a write.

Disk copying, formatting, and other operations that intentionally replace or rewrite media are performed with `DUP` and are described in Chapter 8.

#### 2.6 Disk Status and Capacity

The amount of storage available on a CP/M disk depends on its format. BetterCP/M can therefore operate with disks of different capacities and geometries without assuming that every drive contains the same type of medium.

Disk-status utilities report information about mounted disks, including available storage where applicable. This information reflects the CP/M filesystem capacity of the selected disk rather than simply the raw physical capacity of the medium.

When examining disk space, remember that CP/M allocates file storage in blocks. The amount of free space therefore changes in allocation-block units rather than one byte at a time. A small file can consume an entire allocation block.

Directory space is also finite and is separate from file-data capacity. It is therefore possible for a disk to have unused data space but no free directory entries for additional files.

The disk format also determines such characteristics as allocation-block size and directory capacity. Most users need not work with these values directly during ordinary file operations. `DUP`, `CONFIG`, and the disk-status utilities provide the appropriate information when inspecting, preparing, or configuring disks.

Detailed disk operations and disk formats are covered in Chapter 8.

### 3. Using the Command Environment
#### 3.1 The BetterCP/M Prompt

When BetterCP/M is ready to accept a command, it displays the command prompt. The prompt identifies the current drive and, when appropriate, the current user area.

For example:

```text
A>
```

indicates drive A in the default user area, while:

```text
A5>
```

indicates drive A, user area 5.

Similarly:

```text
B3>
```

indicates drive B, user area 3.

The prompt is redisplayed after a command completes and control returns to the command environment.

Throughout this manual, examples that begin with a prompt show commands as they would be entered at the BetterCP/M console:

```text
A>DIR
```

Only the text following the prompt is typed by the user.

#### 3.2 Entering Commands

Enter a command by typing its name, followed where necessary by operands or options, and press `RETURN`.

For example:

```text
A>DIR
```

displays a directory, while:

```text
A>TYPE README.TXT
```

displays the contents of `README.TXT`.

Commands are not case-sensitive. Lower-case input is accepted and interpreted in the same manner as upper-case input:

```text
A>dir
```

Command names can identify commands built into the command processor, commands supplied by an installed CPX, or transient programs stored on disk. In ordinary use, the distinction does not affect how a command is entered.

Spaces separate a command name from its operands and, where applicable, separate individual operands:

```text
A>COPY SOURCE.TXT B:SOURCE.TXT
```

The syntax description for each command shows which operands are required, which are optional, and which forms of the command are accepted.

BetterCP/M also recognizes drive/user navigation as a command. For example:

```text
A>B3:
B3>
```

selects drive B, user area 3.

#### 3.3 Command-Line Editing

BetterCP/M allows a command line to be edited before it is executed. The cursor can be moved through the line so that errors can be corrected without retyping the entire command.

The command editor supports the familiar WordStar-style control-key conventions used by many CP/M programs. Editing operations include moving the cursor, inserting and deleting characters, and moving within the command line.

For example, if a filename has been mistyped, the cursor can be moved back to the error, the incorrect characters changed, and the completed command then submitted with `RETURN`.

Editing affects only the command currently being entered. The command is not interpreted or executed until it is submitted.

Pressing `RETURN` finishes the command line and moves to a new display line before the command produces output.

The complete command-line editing key assignments are summarized in Appendix B.

#### 3.4 Command History

BetterCP/M maintains a bounded history of previously entered commands. Earlier commands can be recalled to the command line, reviewed or edited, and executed again.

A recalled command behaves like an ordinary command line. It can be executed unchanged or modified with the normal command-line editing keys before `RETURN` is pressed.

Command history is maintained by the command environment rather than by individual transient programs. It therefore remains available when control returns to the prompt after running a program.

The history is preserved across a normal warm boot. A cold boot begins with an empty command history.

Because the history has a fixed capacity, older entries are eventually discarded as newer commands are entered.

Ctrl-K or Up recalls an older history entry; Ctrl-J or Down selects a newer entry.

On the Model 4, Montezuma Micro punctuation chords provide characters missing from its keyboard. Control selects the following characters; Shift may also be held. The key names below refer to the original Model 4 keyboard, rather than the host keyboard layout.

| Character | Model 4 chord |
| --- | --- |
| `[` | Ctrl-8 (Ctrl-parenthesis open) |
| `]` | Ctrl-9 (Ctrl-parenthesis close) |
| `{` | Ctrl-comma (Ctrl-angle bracket open) |
| `}` | Ctrl-period (Ctrl-angle bracket close) |
| `\` | Ctrl-/ |
| &#124; | Ctrl-1 |
| `~` | Ctrl-3 |
| `^` | Ctrl-5 |
| backtick | Ctrl-7 |
| `_` | Ctrl-minus |

An emulator may translate host keys differently. The BIOS requires the corresponding Model 4 key signal; a host key that the emulator does not transmit cannot be recovered by the BIOS. Up and Down remain history keys.

#### 3.5 Selecting Drives and User Areas

The current drive and user area can be changed directly from the command prompt.

To select another drive, enter its letter followed by a colon:

```text
A>B:
B>
```

To select another user area on the current drive, enter the user number followed by a colon:

```text
B>5:
B5>
```

To select both at once, combine the drive letter and user number:

```text
B5>C3:
C3>
```

This selects drive C, user area 3.

BetterCP/M refers to a drive and user-area combination as a **drive/user**, or **DU**. The forms:

```text
B:
5:
C3:
```

are therefore all forms of drive/user navigation.

Changing the current drive/user affects subsequent operations that do not explicitly specify another location. It does not move or copy files between user areas or drives.

Many BetterCP/M commands also accept a drive/user qualification without changing the current selection. For example:

```text
A2>DIR B3:
```

operates on drive B, user area 3 and then returns to the unchanged prompt:

```text
A2>
```

This distinction is useful when working with files on several drives or in several user areas: navigation changes the current working location, while a qualified command can operate elsewhere without doing so.

#### 3.6 Resident and Transient Commands

BetterCP/M commands can be either **resident** or **transient**.

A resident command is available as part of the active command environment and can be executed without first loading an ordinary program from disk. BetterCP/M keeps only a small set of commands in the core command processor; additional resident commands can be supplied by Command Processor Extensions (CPXs).

A transient command is an executable program, normally stored on disk as a `.COM` file. When a command is not handled by the command processor or an installed CPX, BetterCP/M attempts to locate and execute the corresponding transient program.

Some commands are available in both resident and transient forms. The resident form provides commonly used functions without loading a program from disk, while the transient version can provide additional functions. Where the two forms differ, the command description identifies syntax or capabilities available only in the transient version.

For ordinary command entry, the distinction is usually transparent. For example:

```text
A>DIR
```

invokes the available `DIR` command according to the active command environment. The user does not normally need to specify whether the command is resident or transient.

The default BetterCP/M command environment includes the core resident commands and the standard resident command package. CPXs and their management are described in Chapter 6.

##### Explicit transient execution

Prefix a command name with `:` or `.` to bypass built-in and CPX commands
and invoke its `.COM` program through the ordinary transient lookup:

    :DIR B3:*.COM
    .COPY B1:FOO.DAT C3:
    :B3:FOO ARGUMENTS

Both prefixes have the same meaning. Place the prefix before any command DU
qualifier. Arguments retain their normal meaning. The same forms work in
SUBMIT files. A missing program reports the ordinary `?` lookup failure;
there is no fallback to the resident command. This explicitly selects the
transient program; automatic CPX-to-transient handoff is deferred until post-1.0.

#### 3.7 CPX Commands

A **Command Processor Extension**, or **CPX**, extends the BetterCP/M command environment with additional resident commands.

The standard BetterCP/M configuration includes `RCP.CPX`, which provides frequently used commands such as:

```text
DIR   ERA   TYPE   REN   USER
CLS   VER   COPY   MOVE
```

These commands are available without loading an ordinary transient program into the Transient Program Area.

Additional CPXs can be installed when other resident command facilities are required. More than one CPX can be active, and BetterCP/M maintains them in a defined order.

The presence or absence of a CPX does not change the way its commands are typed. If a resident command is unavailable but a corresponding transient program is present, the transient program can provide the command instead.

For example, the standard distribution can provide transient fallbacks for commands that are normally supplied by `RCP.CPX`. This allows a reduced command environment to remain usable without requiring all convenience commands to be resident.

CPXs can be listed, loaded, and unloaded at run time. Chapter 6 describes CPX management and its effect on the command environment.

#### 3.8 Command Search and Program Execution

When a command is entered, BetterCP/M determines how the command is to be handled.

Drive/user navigation is recognized first. Core commands provided directly by the command processor are then checked, followed by commands supplied by the installed CPXs in their configured order. If none of these handles the command, BetterCP/M attempts to execute it as a transient program.

For an unqualified program name, BetterCP/M searches the current drive and user area first, then A0:. A program in the current DU takes precedence. This fixed fallback also applies to explicit transient execution with `:NAME` or `.NAME`. A drive or user qualifier, such as `B3:NAME`, restricts lookup to that location; it does not fall back to A0:.

A program found on A0: runs with the original caller's drive and user area, so unqualified file operands retain their ordinary meaning. A load or read failure after finding a program does not cause another search. This is a fixed lookup rule, not a configurable system path.

Thus, a command such as:

```text
A>MYPROG
```

can cause BetterCP/M to locate `MYPROG.COM`, load it into the Transient Program Area, establish the normal CP/M program environment, and transfer control to it.

Command-line text following the program name is supplied to the program using the standard CP/M command-tail conventions. BetterCP/M also prepares the standard default File Control Blocks and other compatibility-visible program state expected by CP/M software.

For example:

```text
A>MYPROG INPUT.DAT
```

executes `MYPROG.COM` with `INPUT.DAT` supplied as an argument in the conventional CP/M environment.

When the transient program terminates normally, BetterCP/M restores the command environment as necessary and displays the prompt again.

This process preserves the conventional CP/M program-execution model, allowing ordinary CP/M `.COM` programs to run without needing to know how BetterCP/M internally reconstructs its command environment.

#### 3.9 Terminating Commands and Programs

A command normally returns to the BetterCP/M prompt when its operation is complete.

Transient CP/M programs likewise return control to the operating system through the normal CP/M termination mechanisms. BetterCP/M then restores the command environment as necessary and displays the prompt for the next command.

Many commands and programs recognize `Ctrl-C` as an abort or termination request. The precise effect depends on the program being executed. In the command environment and BetterCP/M utilities, `Ctrl-C` is used where appropriate to abandon the current operation and return control to the prompt.

A CP/M warm boot also terminates the current program and returns control to the command environment. BetterCP/M preserves those portions of system state defined to survive a warm boot, including the active extension configuration and valid command history, while reconstructing the parts of the command environment that need to be restored.

Because an interrupted disk operation can leave an operation incomplete, avoid aborting a command while it is actively writing to a disk unless termination is necessary. If a disk operation reports an error or is interrupted unexpectedly, verify the affected files or media before continuing with further modifications. 

#### 3.10 Inline Help at Interactive Prompts

When an interactive prompt offers several abbreviated actions, `?` may display
a short explanation and repeat the prompt, including its file context, for the same item. Asking for help
does not retry, skip, abort, or change the command's current policy.

For example, COPY's collision prompt offers `Y/N/O/S/R/?`. Enter `?` to see
the meaning of those choices. Simple `Y/N` confirmations do not need a help
action, and paging prompts should state their controls directly.

ERA.COM failure recovery uses `R/S/A/?`: retry the current item, skip
it, abort the command, or display help. Noninteractive modes follow their
error policy without prompting;
quiet output does not by itself answer prompts.

### 4. Basic Commands

BetterCP/M provides a set of basic commands for everyday system operation. Some are built directly into the command processor, while others are normally supplied as resident commands by the standard `RCP.CPX`.

Several resident commands also have transient versions stored on disk. The resident version provides the command's basic, frequently used functions without loading a program from disk; the corresponding transient program may provide additional capabilities.

Each command description presents the resident and transient forms together. Where a syntax form, option, or feature is available only in the transient version, it is identified as **transient only**. If no distinction is shown, the described operation is available in both forms where both forms of the command exist.

The syntax descriptions in this chapter use the following conventions:

- Words shown in uppercase identify commands or literal command elements.
- *Italicized words* represent information supplied by the user.
- Items enclosed in square brackets `[ ]` are optional.
- A vertical bar `|` separates alternatives where more than one form is permitted.

Examples show the command as it is entered at the BetterCP/M prompt.

#### 4.1 DIR — Directory

Displays a list of files in the current or specified drive/user area.

`DIR` is available as both a resident command and a transient program. The
resident version supports the standard CP/M 2.2 `DIR` syntax:

    DIR
    DIR filespec
    DIR DU:
    DIR DU:filespec

Examples:

    A>DIR
    A>DIR *.COM
    A>DIR B:
    A>DIR B3:*.ASM

`DIR` without a file specification displays the directory of the selected
drive/user area. A file specification restricts the display to matching files.
The standard CP/M `?` and `*` wildcard characters may be used.

Both forms use the same bounded 8.3 wildcard rules as COPY: `?` matches one
position, and a terminal `*` fills the remainder of its filename or extension
field. Adjacent terminal stars are equivalent to one star. `F?*.DAT` and
`F***.DAT` are valid; `F*A.DAT` and `F**?.DAT` report `Invalid filespec.`
Characters cannot follow a star run within the same field.

Resident DIR also accepts compound DU selections and attribute predicates:

```text
DIR A[0,2]:*.COM
DIR [A0,B3]:*.DOC[$RW]
DIR B[-]:*.COM[$ARC+!$SYS]
```

The full selection is checked before searching. Each selected DU is listed
separately, with a drive/user prefix such as `B3:`. The original drive and user
are restored when DIR finishes. Plain DIR hides SYS files; an explicit attribute
expression controls inclusion of SYS files as well. The current platform
bindings permit drives A: through D:; an unsupported drive rejects the complete
selection. Empty locations report `NO FILE` individually.

##### Transient DIR.COM

**DIR.COM supports compound DU selections and attribute predicates, and works
with RCP unloaded. It combines directory extents into one file entry, supports
sorting, allocated KiB/record and directory-entry units, attribute display, automatic or explicit
columns, paging, per-DU totals and once-per-drive free-space reporting.**
Resident DIR retains its traditional
four-column display, with no sorting, sizes, attribute display or summaries.

Implemented sorting: `/S=N`, `/S=T` and `/S=Z` accept an optional `+` (ascending)
or `-` (descending); `/S=U` preserves native directory order and accepts no sign.
The last sort switch wins. Switches may go before or after the selection operand.
Type and size ties use ascending filename order. Size sorting uses allocated
space, independently of how that size is displayed. Invalid switches reject the
whole command before listing.

`/A` adds a three-position `SRA` field after each file size: SYS, read-only,
and ARC respectively, with `-` for each clear bit. For example, `-R-` means
read-only, and `S-A` means SYS plus ARC. Repeating `/A` is harmless. It does
not select files, reveal SYS files, or change their attributes; use an operand
attribute expression to select them. The display is off again on the next
invocation unless `/A` is specified.

`/Z` and `/Z=K` select allocated KiB (the default). `/Z=S` displays allocated
128-byte records, not physical floppy sectors or logical file length. `/Z=E`
counts physical directory entries occupied by the file. An empty file still
occupies one directory entry. This is not a count of logical 16 KiB extents;
one physical entry can describe several logical extents on some formats.
Per-file sizes and each selected-DU total use the chosen unit, with `K`, `S` or `E`
as the suffix. The last valid size-unit switch wins; a later `/Z` restores K.
Unit selection resets to K on the next invocation. Sorting by `/S=Z` continues
to use allocated space regardless of the display unit.

`/P` pauses after 23 output lines on the standard 24-row display. Headings,
blank lines and summaries count toward the page. The prompt spells out the
controls: Space or Enter continues, and Ctrl-C aborts DIR and restores your
original drive and user. Other keys are ignored. Repeating `/P` is harmless;
paging is off again for the next DIR command. A listing that ends exactly at
the page boundary does not require an extra key.

DIR automatically uses four, two or one column, whichever fits the selected
entries on the supported 80-column display. It measures the actual size digits
and optional attribute field, and aligns adjacent cells with ` : ` separators.
`/C=1`, `/C=2` or `/C=4` requests a specific count; the last `/C=` wins. If that
count cannot fit, DIR reports `Requested columns do not fit.` before listing
that DU. Column selection and sorting apply separately to each selected DU.
Use `/C=1 /P` when you want a paged, one-file-per-line listing. The next command
returns to automatic columns unless `/C=` is supplied again.

Each DU retains its heading and ends with a combined summary such as
`---- 30 FILES, 184K TOTAL, 146K FREE ----`. File sizes are right-aligned;
column separators remain ` : `. Empty listings report `NO FILE`, then free
space. Free space repeats for each selected DU and always uses KiB, even
with `/Z=S` or `/Z=E`. DIR restores your original drive and user when finished.

It will not display or
filter dates, timestamps or wheel-protection attributes in 1.0.

```text
DIR [options] [location:filespec[attribute-expression]]
```

Omitting the location uses the current drive/user. Omitting the filespec uses
`*.*`. To select the transient explicitly, use `:DIR` or `.DIR`; automatic
handoff from resident DIR is deferred until post-1.0. The examples below describe the
implemented transient behavior.

##### Selecting locations and files

```text
DIR *.COM
DIR B7:*.COM
DIR B[3-5]:*.COM
DIR B[-]:*.COM
DIR [A0,B[3-5],C[4,5,9],5]:*.COM
```

`B[-]:` selects all users on B:. A bare user term such as the final `5` in the
last example inherits the drive that was current when DIR began. Selector
brackets belong to the location; brackets after the filespec are attribute
qualifiers. `[*]` is not an alias for all users.

Wildcards retain the resident bounded rules described above. Extended selectors
do not change filename matching.

##### Selecting files by attributes

| Qualifier | Matches |
| --- | --- |
| `[$RO]` | Read-only files |
| `[$RW]` | Writable files |
| `[$SYS]` | System files |
| `[$DIR]` | Files without SYS set |
| `[$ARC]` | Files with ARC set |

`$R/O` and `$R/W` are aliases for `$RO` and `$RW`. Expressions use `!` for NOT,
`+` for AND and comma for OR, with precedence NOT, AND, then OR:

```text
DIR *.COM[$ARC+!$SYS]
DIR *.DOC[$RO,$SYS]
DIR *.*[!$ARC]
```

These select ARC-marked non-SYS `.COM` files, `.DOC` files with RO or SYS set,
and files with ARC clear, respectively. Qualifiers select files without changing
their attributes. They do not accept size/date queries, parentheses or `$WHL`.

SYS files are hidden by default. An explicit attribute predicate replaces that
default suppression: any SYS file satisfying the predicate is displayed. For
example, `[$RW]` also includes writable SYS files; `[$RW+!$SYS]` excludes them.
Predicates such as `[$SYS]` or `[$SYS,$RO]` display their matches rather than silently
applying the default suppression.

##### Display and sorting options

Options are case-insensitive. `/A` and `/P` may be repeated harmlessly. For
value-bearing size, column and sort options, the last value wins.

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `/A` | Display the three-character SYS/RO/ARC field |
| `/P` | Pause after each screenful |
| `/Z` or `/Z=K` | Display allocated kilobytes; the default |
| `/Z=S` | Display size in allocated record units |
| `/Z=E` | Count physical directory entries used |
| `/C=1`, `/C=2`, `/C=4` | Request that many columns |
| `/S=N`, `/S=N+`, `/S=N-` | Sort by name ascending or descending |
| `/S=T`, `/S=T+`, `/S=T-` | Sort by extension ascending or descending |
| `/S=Z`, `/S=Z+`, `/S=Z-` | Sort by size ascending or descending |
| `/S=U` | Keep native directory-search order |

Name ascending is the default sort. Size sorting uses a numeric size metric,
not the printed size text; changing `/Z=` does not change the sorting key.
`/S=U+` and `/S=U-` are invalid. Other invalid values include `/C=3`, `/Z=X`
and `/S=Q`.

The attribute field is always three positions, **SRA**. A clear bit displays
`-`: `---` means none set, `-R-` means read-only, and `S-A` means SYS plus ARC.
`/A` displays attributes; it does not select ARC files or make SYS visible by
itself. A selector does not turn on `/A` automatically.

For example, this planned command selects ARC-marked non-SYS `.COM` files,
displays attributes and lists the largest first:

```text
DIR /A /S=Z- B7:*.COM[$ARC+!$SYS]
```

Size is always displayed. Automatic layout chooses the greatest supported
column count that fits: four, then two, then one. An explicit `/C=` request
that will not fit reports an error; DIR does not silently reduce it.

Here is an illustrative one-column listing; names and sizes are examples:

```text
A0>:DIR /A /C=1
A: COPY     COM    9K  --A
A: README   TXT    1K  ---
A: STAT     COM    7K  -R-
3 FILES, 17K TOTAL, 116K FREE
A0>
```

##### Paging, summaries and multiple user areas

Paging is off unless `/P` is supplied. At a page pause, Space or Return displays
the next page; Ctrl-C aborts the listing and restores the caller's DU/context.
DIR never changes file attributes or directory entries.

Each summary counts only selected files. Per-file size and selected-file TOTAL
use the same `/Z=` unit; free space always uses KiB. `1 FILE` uses singular
wording. No matches reports `NO FILE` followed by free space.

For multi-DU selectors, DIR lists and sorts each DU separately, with a heading:

```text
B3:
BAR      COM   8K : FOO      COM   6K
---- 2 FILES, 14K TOTAL, 94K FREE ----

B4:
TEST     COM   4K : UTIL     COM   7K
---- 2 FILES, 11K TOTAL, 94K FREE ----
```

The example uses illustrative values. An empty DU does not stop later selected
DUs. DIR does not merge all DUs into one listing or sort across them.

The default transient presentation is name-sorted, with K sizes, attributes
hidden, paging off, automatic columns and summaries on. Precise record/extent
accounting and terminal geometry will be qualified before release.

#### 4.2 ERA — Erase Files

Erases one or more files from the current or specified drive/user area.

Resident `ERA` supports the shared BetterCP/M file-selection language:

    ERA filespec
    ERA DU:filespec
    ERA B[1,3,8-10]:*.BAK
    ERA [A0,B[3-5]]:*.DOC[$ARC]
    ERA /VER

It validates the complete selection before erasing anything and restores your
original drive/user area afterward. The bounded wildcard rules apply: `F?*.DAT`
and `F***.DAT` are valid; `F*A.DAT`, `F**?.DAT`, and overlong 8.3 names report
`Invalid filespec.`.

Resident ERA always skips read-only (`$RO`) and system (`$SYS`) files, including
files explicitly selected with those attributes. Attribute selection never
overrides this protection. Ordinary selected files are erased in each selected
DU. Bare `ERA` reports `NO FILE`; an all-wildcard name/extension, including an
omitted filespec after a location, asks `ALL (Y/N)?` once for the whole selection.
Only `Y` proceeds. Protected files remain protected after that confirmation.

Resident ERA provides basic error handling and no completion summary. Its richer
erase options (`/Y`, `/Q`, `/QQ`, `/C`, `/N`, `/R`, `/D`, `/DRV`) are unsupported.
Use `:ERA` to invoke the transient implementation explicitly; the expanded
ERA.COM now implements the ordinary workflow described below.

##### Transient ERA.COM

The following interface is the agreed target for the expanded ERA.COM. The
ordinary and destructive workflows (`/Y`, `/Q`, `/C`, `/R`, `/D`) are implemented
and qualified. `/QQ`, `/N` and `/DRV` remain unsupported and are rejected before
erasure. The implementation contract is recorded in
[ERA Specification](../engineering/ERA%20Specification.md).


`ERA` removes files from disk.

BetterCP/M ERA extends the traditional CP/M command with multi-DU selection, attribute selection, confirmation controls, read-only protection, and destructive erase with `/D`.

Basic syntax:

```text
ERA [options] filespec[attributes]
```

Examples:

```text
ERA OLD.DOC
ERA *.BAK
ERA B[-]:*.DOC
ERA B[-]:*.DOC[$ARC]
```

---

##### Ordinary erase

For one exact file:

```text
ERA TOM.DOC
```

ERA asks:

```text
TOM.DOC - Erase? Y/N
```

For a set of files, ERA shows what it intends to erase before doing anything:

```text
THE FOLLOWING FILES WILL BE ERASED:

OLD1.BAK     OLD2.BAK     TEST.BAK     TEMP.BAK
SAVE.BAK     JUNK.BAK

6 FILES, 27K TOTAL

ERASE THESE FILES? Y/N
```

Large lists are displayed in multiple columns and paged automatically:

```text
MORE -- Space/ENTER for next page.
```

---

##### Selecting files

ERA supports BetterCP/M DU selectors:

```text
ERA B[1,3,8-10]:*.DOC
ERA B[-]:*.BAK
ERA [A0,B[3-5],C[-]]:*.TMP
```

It also supports attribute qualifiers:

```text
ERA *.DOC[$ARC]
ERA *.DOC[$SYS+$ARC]
ERA *.DOC[$RO+$ARC]
```

Attribute operators are:

```text
!    NOT
+    AND
,    OR
```

Examples:

```text
[$ARC+!$SYS]
[$RW,$RO]
```

---

##### Protected files

ERA deliberately protects SYS and read-only files.

A normal broad erase does not casually erase protected files.

To select SYS files deliberately:

```text
ERA *.DOC[$SYS]
```

To select archived SYS files:

```text
ERA *.DOC[$SYS+$ARC]
```

Protected attributes must be explicitly selected in the **same matching OR
branch**. For example, `[$SYS+$RO,$ARC]` admits a file with both SYS and RO
through its first branch. A SYS+ARC file without RO matches only `$ARC` and
remains protected. Mentioning `$SYS` in a branch that does not match grants no
authorization. `[$SYS,$RO]` does not authorize a file having both attributes;
use `[$SYS+$RO]` for that class. `!$DIR` means `$SYS`, and `!$RW` means `$RO`.

Read-only files require additional authorization.

To select them:

```text
ERA *.DOC[$RO]
```

To authorize their erasure without the read-only protection step:

```text
ERA /R *.DOC[$RO]
```

Without `/R`, an explicitly selected RO file asks:

```text
B4:TOM.DOC - Read only. Erase? Y/N
```

This one prompt also satisfies `/C` for that file. `N` skips the file; Ctrl-C
aborts the whole command. An exact single RO file goes directly to this prompt;
a multi-file operation still has its separate batch confirmation.

`/Y` does **not** imply `/R`: it skips RO files without prompting. `/R` never
broadens selection or bypasses SYS protection.

---

##### Options

###### `/D` — destructive erase

```text
ERA /D SECRET.DAT
```

overwrites the file's allocated data with zeroes and then destroys the residual directory metadata.

For multiple files ERA warns:

```text
THE FOLLOWING FILES WILL BE DESTRUCTIVELY ERASED:
```

and finally:

```text
DESTRUCTIVELY ERASE THESE FILES? THIS IS UNRECOVERABLE. Y/N
```

For a file sharing allocation blocks with another live file, destructive erase
must leave the shared blocks unchanged and zero only the unshared blocks.
This protects the other file's data; it is not a complete zeroing of the selected
file's allocated data. After zeroing the unshared blocks, ERA scrubs the selected
file's directory entries and reports "erased; shared blocks retained". This
outcome is counted separately from fully destructive erasures.

If directory scrubbing fails after some entries have been scrubbed, Retry resumes
from the saved entry list. Skip or Abort reports an incomplete destructive erase.
ERA does not attempt to restore entries after the data has been zeroed.

Destructive erase is transient-only. It is not described as cryptographic secure erase. If a data overwrite fails, directory entries remain identifiable, but file data may be partially zeroed. Only successful overwrite and directory scrubbing count as destructive erasure.

---

###### `/Y` — assume Yes

```text
ERA /Y *.BAK
```

performs the operation without the manifest or ordinary confirmation prompts. It also skips RO files unless `/R` authorizes their erasure, and never pauses for failure recovery.

Useful in SUBMIT files.

`/Y` does not override read-only protection.

To erase deliberately selected RO files unattended:

```text
ERA /Y /R *.BAK[$RO]
```

---

###### `/R` — allow read-only erase

```text
ERA /R *.BAK[$RO]
```

authorizes erasure of selected read-only files.

Without `/R`, explicitly selected read-only files require a separate per-file authorization. Under `/Y`, they are skipped instead. `/R` does not broaden the selector.

---

###### `/Q` — quiet

```text
ERA /Q *.BAK
```

suppresses the filename listing and ordinary informational output, but does not suppress required interaction.

Thus the command still asks:

```text
ERASE THESE FILES? Y/N
```

For fully unattended quiet operation:

```text
ERA /Y /Q *.BAK
```

---

###### `/C` — confirm each file

```text
ERA /C *.DOC
```

first performs the ordinary group confirmation, then asks about each erasable file:

```text
BOB.TXT Y/N
FRED.COM Y/N
```

Protected files which ERA is not authorized to erase are skipped rather than turned into ordinary `/C` questions.

With `/R`, selected RO files participate normally in `/C`. `/Y` suppresses `/C` confirmations; `/Q` does not.

---

##### Errors

If an erase operation fails interactively:

```text
ERA TOM.DOC - Failed. R/S/A/?
```

Enter:

```text
R    Retry
S    Skip
A    Abort all
?    Show help
```

Entering `?` displays:

```text
R Retry, S Skip, A Abort all.
```

and repeats the prompt.

With `/Y`, ERA never pauses for this recovery menu; it reports the failed file, skips it, and continues when safe.

---

##### Completion summary

ERA finishes with a compact summary:

```text
12 FILES ERASED, 2 SKIPPED, 1 FAILED, 47K FREED
```

For destructive erase:

```text
12 FILES DESTRUCTIVELY ERASED, 2 SKIPPED, 1 FAILED, 47K FREED
```

`FREED` is actual allocated disk space released, not logical file length.

`/Q` suppresses this normal summary. Zero-valued categories are omitted; skipped and failed files contribute nothing to `FREED`. No qualifying files reports `NO FILE` without confirmation.

---

##### Archiving files and then deleting the originals

ARC denotes changed since last backup. The following cleanup selects files whose ARC bit is set; it does not prove those files were copied successfully.

After confirming every selected file was successfully copied, the planned cleanup sequence is:

```text
COPY B[-]:*.*[$ARC] D0:
ERA    B[-]:*.*[$ARC]
ERA    B[-]:*.*[$SYS+$ARC]
ERA /R B[-]:*.*[$RO+$ARC]
```

The separate ERA commands are intentional.

ERA's SYS and RO protections are not weakened merely to make every protected case fit into one command line.

---

##### Backing up files while retaining the originals

The convenient form is:

```text
COPY /BACKUP B[-]:*.DOC[$ARC] D0:
```

`/BACKUP` clears ARC on both source and destination only after successful copy/close and any requested verification. Add `/V` when verification is wanted; `/BACKUP` does not imply it.

A future STAT ARC-clearing operation could provide a manual source-side workflow. The following STAT syntax is proposed and is not currently implemented:

```text
COPY B[-]:*.DOC[$ARC] D0:
STAT B[-]:*.DOC[$ARC] !$ARC
```

This would clear source ARC only, unlike `/BACKUP`, which clears source and destination ARC. Use such a manual step only after checking every selected source was successfully copied; a partial or skipped batch must not be followed by clearing the entire source selection.

This illustrates a broader BetterCP/M design principle: the utilities expose sufficiently general primitives that higher-level workflows can be composed from ordinary commands.

#### 4.3 REN — Rename Files

Resident `REN` renames files in place:

    REN template=source
    REN source template

Examples:

    REN NEW.TXT=B3:OLD.TXT
    REN *.TXT=B[-]:*.DOC
    REN X?*.BAK=[A3,B5]:*.DOC[$RW]

The source accepts the shared DU selectors, bounded wildcards and attribute
expressions. The template must contain only a filename pattern, with no drive
or user qualifier. Each result remains in its source DU; use COPY or MOVE to
change locations.

Template literals replace the corresponding filename positions. `?` copies
one source position, and a terminal `*` copies the remainder of that field.
Name and extension are separate fields. Repeated terminal stars are equivalent
to one star; characters following a star run are invalid. The historical `_`
separator is also accepted when no `=` is present.

REN validates the complete command syntax before renaming. It processes selected
files in filename order within each DU. Read-only and system files are skipped,
even when explicitly selected. An existing target stops the command; another
selected source is also an existing target, so rename chains and swaps are not
resolved. Earlier renames remain in place. Identical target names in different
DUs are permitted. A file mapped to its own name is unchanged.

REN preserves contents and attributes and restores the caller's DU. An
unexpected failure during execution stops the command; previously completed
renames are not rolled back.

##### Transient REN

The transient REN interface is recorded in the
[REN engineering specification](../engineering/REN%20Specification.md).
The transient supports both operand orders,
shared multi-DU and attribute selection, positional templates, `/C`, `/Y`, `/N`,
`/DRY`, `/P`, `/Q`, `/QQ` and standalone `/VER`. Switches may appear as separate tokens
before, between or after the operands. `/DRY` lists proposed mappings and
suppresses every rename; `/N` also suppresses writes without requiring `/C`.
`/Y` and `/QQ` skip existing targets and continue. `/QQ` preserves an explicit
`/N`; `/DRY /QQ` is silent. The last `/Y` or `/N`, and the last `/Q` or `/QQ`, wins.
Use `:REN` to request the transient explicitly.

`/P` permits selected RO/SYS files to be renamed while preserving their
attributes. Without `/P`, RO/SYS files are skipped. `/P` does not override a
read-only drive. Files whose extents have inconsistent attributes are refused
before changes. If attributes cannot be restored after an operation, REN stops
and reports the problem; earlier changes remain in effect. Interactive collisions now offer `N/S/A/?`: supply a
new literal name, skip the file, abort the remainder, or display help. Invalid
replacement names reprompt; blank returns to the collision menu. Backspace/DEL
edits, Ctrl-U clears the response, and Ctrl-C aborts the remainder. Earlier
renames remain in effect. Existing files are never overwritten.

Operational failures offer `R/S/A/?`: retry the current rename, skip that file,
abort the remainder, or display inline help. Retry checks the target again and
does not repeat an already answered `/C` confirmation. `/Y` and `/QQ` count
failures and continue without prompting. Successful retries count as renamed;
unrecovered failures count as FAILED in the completion summary.

REN changes filenames in place. It never moves a file to another drive or user
area. The two planned forms are equivalent:

```text
REN source template
REN template=source
```

For example:

```text
REN B[-]:*.DOC *.TXT
REN *.TXT=B[-]:*.DOC
REN [A0,B[3-5],C7]:*.DOC[$ARC] *.TXT
```

The source can select multiple DUs, wildcard names and file attributes. The
name template must have no location: `*.TXT` is valid; `B3:*.TXT` is not.
Each result stays in its original DU. File contents and attributes are retained.

Templates follow COPY's positional rules, independently for name and extension:
literals replace source positions, `?` retains one source position, and a
terminal `*` retains the rest of the field. Repeated terminal stars are
redundant. Characters after a star run, such as `F*A`, are invalid. Thus
`REN *.DOC *.TXT` changes the extension without changing the name.

###### Planned transient options

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `/C` | Confirm each eligible rename with `Y/N`. |
| `/Y` | Automatically answer Yes to confirmations; does not override protection. |
| `/N` | Automatically answer No in `/C` mode, displaying proposed mappings. |
| `/DRY` | Preview with a guaranteed absence of writes, even with `/Y`. |
| `/P` | Allow selected read-only and system files to be renamed. |
| `/Q` | Suppress routine successful mappings; retain noteworthy outcomes and summary. |
| `/QQ` | Suppress normal REN output and assume `/Y` when it was not supplied. |
| `/VER` | Print the version and build banner, then exit without renaming. |

By default, the planned implementation renames eligible files immediately and
reports results. Read-only and system files are skipped unless `/P` is supplied.
Attribute predicates select files; `/P` separately permits protection override:

```text
:REN /P *.DOC[$RO] *.TXT
```

This selects only read-only `.DOC` files and permits their rename. `/P` does
not broaden the selection. Resident REN's target subset does not require `/P`;
STAT can remove protection temporarily and restore it after renaming.

Use `/DRY` for a guaranteed preview:

```text
:REN /DRY B[-]:*.DOC *.TXT
```

Visible dry runs end with `Dry run only: no files were renamed.` Neither `/Y`
nor its position in the command can override `/DRY`. With `/C`, `/N` displays
proposed mappings without synthetic `N` responses on each line. If both `/Y`
and `/N` appear without `/DRY`, the later confirmation policy wins.

###### Collisions and failures

An existing target is never overwritten. Interactive collisions offer:

```text
File exists. N/S/A/?
```

`N` means **New name**, `S` skips this file, and `A` aborts the remainder.
`?` prints `N New name, S Skip file, A Abort remainder.` and repeats the prompt.
A new name must be locationless and valid 8.3; if it also exists, the collision
prompt returns. A file mapped to its own name is unchanged and may count as
skipped.

Operational failures offer:

```text
REN A.DOC - Failed. R/S/A/?
```

`R` retries, `S` skips, and `A` aborts the remainder. `?` prints
`R Retry, S Skip file, A Abort remainder.` and reprompts without changing state.
Under `/Y`, recoverable operational failures default to Skip.

Execution is incremental: aborting leaves earlier successful renames in place.
REN does not promise rollback or an atomic batch. Multi-DU reports group
mappings beneath headings such as `A0:` and `B3:`. Normal and `/Q` reports end
with a summary such as `12 FILES RENAMED, 2 SKIPPED, 1 FAILED`, omitting
zero-count categories. No matches may report `NO FILE`.

`/Q` does not answer prompts. `/QQ` suppresses mappings, skip notices,
no-match messages, syntax diagnostics and summaries. When explicit `/Y` is
absent, the proposed ordinary super-quiet behavior first prints once:

```text
REN: /Y not specified. /QQ assumes /Y.
```

Explicit `/Y /QQ` omits that notice. `/QQ` never implies `/P`; `/DRY` always
prevents writes and suppresses its usual preview/footer under `/QQ`. Lower-level
OS diagnostics may still appear. Unattended collision policy, `/QQ /N`, and
the `/DRY /QQ` notice interaction remain implementation questions in the
engineering specification; do not rely on those combinations yet.

Resident REN supports both `REN source template` and `REN template=source`,
shared source selection, positional templates and `/VER`. It skips RO and SYS
files, including explicitly selected protected files. It never overwrites an
existing target; a collision stops processing and keeps earlier successful
renames. All renames stay within each source DU. The richer
confirmation, preview, override and reporting options above belong to REN.COM.


#### 4.4 TYPE — Display Text Files

TYPE displays text on the console. Resident TYPE is the small core command;
TYPE.COM is planned to provide the fuller paging facility. Resident TYPE is
implemented. TYPE.COM currently implements shared selection and streaming
transformations, bidirectional paging and explicit file navigation. Both forms
are qualified on the current 80-column, 24-row platforms.

Both forms use the shared filespec, DU selector and attribute predicates:

```text
TYPE README.TXT
TYPE B3:README.TXT
TYPE B[-]:*.TXT
TYPE [A0,B3,C[4-6]]:*.DOC
TYPE B[-]:*.DOC[$ARC]
```

Text ends at the raw CP/M EOF byte, 1Ah, or the end of the file. TYPE does not
modify files. It does not decompress data or offer binary inspection; use a
suitable viewer or DUMP for those tasks.

**Resident TYPE.** Without `/P`, stream the selected files continuously, with a
simple separator between files. `/P` provides forward paging; Space and `.`
advance one page. Backward and file navigation are transient features. The
resident Ctrl-C cancels at the paging prompt. Resident paging pauses after
every 23 source line feeds; long-line screen wrapping is not counted.

**TYPE.COM.** Force transient execution with `:TYPE` or `.TYPE`. Without `/P`,
stream files without normal paging pauses. A multi-file selection prints a
banner such as `---------- B3:README.TXT ----------` before each file. A single
exact file may omit the banner.

Current TYPE.COM Build 004 supports `/P`, `/7`, `/T`, `/CTL` and `/VER`. Options
may precede or follow the source operand. Page and file movement are implemented.

| Option | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `/P` | Forward/backward paging and file-boundary navigation |
| `/7` | Strip the high bit from displayed bytes; test raw 1Ah for EOF first |
| `/T` | Expand tabs to fixed 8-column stops |
| `/CTL` | Show controls as caret notation; overrides `/T` for tabs |
| `/VER` | Print version/build information and exit |

For example:

```text
:TYPE B[-]:*.DOC /P
:TYPE README.TXT /7
:TYPE README.TXT /T
:TYPE README.TXT /CTL
```

In transient paged mode:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Ctrl-R or `,` | Previous page |
| Ctrl-C, `.` or Space | Next page |
| `<` | Beginning of current file; if already there, beginning of previous file |
| `>` | Beginning of next file |
| Ctrl-Q | Quit |

Ctrl-C means next page only while TYPE.COM waits for a paging command. During
ordinary output, normal console/BDOS Ctrl-C handling still applies. This abrupt
warm boot retains the displayed file's drive and user area; TYPE cannot run its
cleanup after BDOS aborts it. Normal completion and Ctrl-Q at a paged prompt
restore your original drive and user area.

Esc does not quit TYPE.COM. Movement beyond the first or last selected file
stays at the nearest valid position. A page may contain the end of one file,
the next banner and the beginning of the next file. At the end of the final file, the final page remains displayed until Ctrl-Q.
Next-page commands then do nothing; backward navigation remains available.
`>` still visits a later file boundary when the page starts in an earlier file.
At the last anchored file, `>` does nothing. Backward page navigation has no fixed history limit: older pages are rebuilt
by rereading from the start of the selection. This may be slow on floppy media.

The current file is the file at the top-of-page anchor, even if the page later
crosses into another file. A banner at the top belongs to the file it introduces.
`>` places the next file's banner at the top, even if it is already visible
mid-screen. `<` moves back only as far as the current file's beginning, putting
its banner at the top; this may be a partial-screen movement. Another `<` from
there visits the previous file. Boundary jumps redraw the screen.

An empty file is valid: multi-file display prints its banner and continues,
without an `[EMPTY]` marker. Empty files remain available to file navigation but
do not create a fictitious content page.

Transient pages count display rows, including screen-edge spillover, rather
than source lines. The current platforms use an 80-column, 24-row console;
TYPE.COM reserves a prompt row, leaving 23 file-display rows. Tabs advance
to 8-column stops for page accounting even without `/T`. Resident accounting
may be simpler to keep its implementation small.

With `/CTL`, TAB appears as `^I` rather than expanding, and form feed
appears as `^L` without clearing the screen. CR/LF is shown as `^M^J` while
retaining line structure. With `/CTL`, bare CR or LF also ends a display line;
a CR/LF pair produces one line break. DEL appears as `^?`, and other controls
use conventional caret notation without executing their terminal actions.
Raw 1Ah remains EOF and is not displayed. With `/7`, raw 9Ah becomes
display data 1Ah and does not end text. `/7 /CTL` shows it as `^Z`; without
`/CTL`, it passes through the ordinary display path. Without
`/T`, tabs pass through to the console. Long lines follow the console's normal
screen-edge behavior; there is no `/W`, `/C=`, or horizontal scrolling.

Open/read failures report the affected file and continue with the next file,
without an error-response prompt. For example:

```text
TYPE B3:FOO.TXT - Cannot open.
TYPE B3:FOO.TXT - Read error.
```

Fatal failures terminate the command. No `/B` switch is needed; unpaged display
and its error handling are already suitable for unattended use. `/P` explicitly
requests interactive navigation.

TYPE.COM assumes files stay stable during display. It does not snapshot their
contents or promise to detect changes. Revisiting a page can display newer data;
open/read failures during reconstruction follow the same skip policy.

The target `/VER` banners follow the common version convention:

```text
BetterCP/M TYPE 1.0 (Resident, Build nnn)
BetterCP/M TYPE 1.0 (Build nnn)
```

Searching, line numbering, line scrolling, runtime display changes, decompression,
hex display and editing belong to VIEW or other utilities, rather than TYPE.

#### 4.5 USER — Select User Area

Selects the current user area.

Syntax:

    USER number

where `number` is a user area from 0 through 31.

Examples:

    A>USER 3
    A3>USER 17
    A17>

BetterCP/M also permits the user area to be selected directly by entering the
user number followed by a colon:

    A>3:
    A3>

or together with a drive:

    A3>B17:
    B17>

`USER` is retained as a resident command for compatibility with conventional
CP/M usage. There is no separate transient `USER.COM`.


#### 4.6 COPY — Copy Files

Copies one or more files to another file, drive, or user area.

`COPY` is available as both a resident command and a transient program. Both
versions accept either source-first or destination-first syntax:

    COPY source destination
    COPY destination=source

Examples:

    A>COPY README.TXT README.BAK
    A>COPY README.TXT B:
    A>COPY *.COM B:
    A>COPY A3:*.ASM B17:
    A>COPY B:README.TXT=README.TXT
    A>COPY B:=*.COM

The two syntax forms are equivalent. When the destination does not specify a
new filename, the source filename is retained.

Wildcards may be used to copy groups of files. Drive and user-area
specifications may be used with the source and destination without changing
the current drive/user.

Resident COPY and MOVE share the same source-selection engine. Sources may
span multiple DUs and use attribute expressions:

    COPY [A0,B[5-7],C[3,5,6],5]:*.COM D3:
    COPY B[-]:*.DOC[$RW+!$SYS] C4:
    MOVE [A3,B5]:*.BAK C4:

Their destination must resolve to exactly one DU. A set notation which resolves
to one DU is accepted; multiple destination DUs are rejected. Resident commands
retain each source filename for a DU-only target. An exact destination filename
is allowed only when the entire selection contains one file; destination
wildcard templates remain a transient COPY feature.

Both resident commands preflight the full selection before writing. Duplicate
target names from different source DUs and overlap with any selected source
reject the invocation. Existing targets are rejected unless resident COPY has
its trailing `/O` option; read-only targets remain protected. MOVE does not
overwrite, and read-only sources are rejected before any move. No matching
files reports `NO FILE`. The caller DU is restored.

The source files remain unchanged after a successful copy.

In addition to the above, the transient `COPY.COM` provides extended
file-copying functions while retaining both syntax forms.

##### Transient COPY Syntax

`COPY.COM` accepts destination wildcard templates as well as source wildcards:

    COPY C3:*.DOC=A4:*.COM
    COPY C3:X?*.BAK=A4:FOOBAR.COM

The second example creates `XOOBAR.BAK`. Destination literals replace the
corresponding source positions, `?` retains one source position, and a terminal
`*` retains the remainder of that filename field.

COPY.COM also accepts extended DU selectors on the source, with one destination:

    :COPY [A0,B[5-7],C[3,5,6],5]:*.COM D3:
    :COPY [A[-],B[-],C[-]]:*.COM D0:

The final user-only `5` inherits the caller's original drive. Sources are
collected in drive/user order, with names sorted within each DU. Repeated DU
selections do not repeat files. The destination cannot be a DU set.

Preflight covers the combined source set. Equal generated destination names
from different source locations reject the entire batch, even with `/O`.
A destination that overlaps any selected source also rejects it. An unavailable
source drive or a combined selection exceeding 64 files stops before writing.
A selected DU with no matches contributes no files; if no DU has a match,
COPY reports `NO FILE`.

Global options may precede or follow the operands, or occur in both groups:

```text
COPY /V /B B1:*.COM C0:
COPY /V C0: = B1:*.COM /B
```

Whitespace around `=` is optional. Options between source and destination are
not accepted. Leading and trailing groups share the same invocation-wide
policy; `/O` and `/S` conflict even when supplied in different groups.

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `/O` | Replace existing writable destination files. |
| `/S` | Skip existing writable destination files. |
| `/B` | Run without collision prompts. See section 5.7. |
| `/V` | Reopen and compare source and destination records after copying. |

`/O` and `/S` cannot be combined. `/V` and `/B` may be combined with either. Read-only
destinations are never overwritten; they report `READ ONLY`, fail that file,
and allow processing to continue.

Without `/B`, `/O` or `/S`, an existing writable destination prompts:

    [Destination exists. Overwrite? Y/N/O/S/R/?]

`Y` replaces that file; `N` skips it. `O` replaces this and subsequent writable
collisions; `S` skips this and subsequent collisions. `?` displays help and
repeats the prompt. The O/S choice lasts only for the current COPY invocation.
At a collision prompt, Ctrl-C aborts COPY, preserving completed earlier copies
and the existing destination.

`R` asks for `New Name:` in the same destination DU. Enter a bare exact 8.3
filename, without wildcards or a DU qualifier. Invalid names reprompt. A name
that conflicts with a selected source or another planned batch destination
also reprompts without writing. Blank input returns to the collision prompt;
Ctrl-C aborts COPY. If the new name already exists, normal collision handling
applies to that name, including read-only protection.

During copying and `/V` comparison, COPY checks for Ctrl-C between 128-byte
records. Ctrl-C removes the current incomplete or unverified destination,
preserves completed earlier files, restores the caller's DU and DMA, and returns
to the prompt. A disk operation already in progress finishes before the next
check. Other keys during transfer are ignored; `/B` does not disable Ctrl-C.

With `/V`, COPY verifies every 128-byte record and requires matching logical
ends before applying attributes. A verification failure prompts `R/S/?`:
`R` retries from the beginning, `S` removes the failed destination and continues,
and `?` displays help. Ctrl-C removes the failed destination and aborts COPY.
With `/B`, failure removes the destination and continues without prompting or
automatic retry. SUBMIT alone retains interactive verification prompts.

Before copying, the transient checks the complete mapping. Duplicate
destinations, exact self-copy, destinations overlapping selected sources, and
invalid generated names reject the operation without changing a destination.
`/O` cannot override these checks. The current transient limit is 64 matched
files; a larger batch reports `COPY BATCH TOO LARGE` before writing.

Each successful transient copy reports its source, destination, and allocated
space on the destination disk:

```text
B1:FOO.COM -> D0:FOO.COM [2K]
```

`K` means 1024 bytes. The size includes allocation-block rounding; an empty file
reports `0K`. For batches selecting more than one file, COPY reports nonzero
copied, skipped, and failed totals. Only successful copies contribute to the
allocation total:

```text
3 FILES COPIED [18K]
1 FILE SKIPPED
1 FILE FAILED
```

These extended forms require `COPY.COM`. Use `:COPY` or `.COPY` to select it
explicitly while automatic resident-to-transient handoff is deferred until post-1.0.


##### COPY attribute selection and backup

**Source attribute selection, destination attribute qualifiers, and /BACKUP
are implemented in transient COPY.COM.**

For example, this supported command selects ARC-marked files across all B:
users and copies them to D0:, preserving attributes without changing source ARC:

```text
COPY /B /V B[-]:*.COM[$ARC] D0:
```

Source filtering takes place before global mapping checks and the 64-file limit.
No matches reports `NO FILE`. Invalid expressions fail before writes.

Command-wide options use `/`; qualifiers attached to an operand use brackets.
For example, the planned backup syntax is:

```text
COPY /V /BACKUP B[-]:*.COM[$ARC] D0:
```

This selects `.COM` files across all user areas on B: **whose ARC bit is set**,
copies them to D0:, verifies their contents, then clears ARC on both the source
and destination after success. `/B` continues to mean noninteractive batch;
`/BACKUP` is a separate option.

ARC means “changed since the last completed backup.” Ordinary COPY preserves
ARC and leaves the source unchanged. `[$ARC]` only selects files; it does not
change their attributes. `/BACKUP` alone does not filter files by ARC.

Source attribute qualifiers select files:

| Qualifier | Selects |
| --- | --- |
| `[$RO]` | Read-only files |
| `[$RW]` | Writable files |
| `[$SYS]` | System files |
| `[$DIR]` | Files without SYS set |
| `[$ARC]` | Files with ARC set |

Use `!` for NOT, `+` for AND and comma for OR. AND binds more tightly than OR:
`[$ARC+!$SYS]` selects ARC-marked files without SYS; `[$RO,$SYS]` selects files
with RO or SYS. `$R/O` and `$R/W` are aliases for `$RO` and `$RW`.

Destination qualifiers set the completed copy's attributes after the copy and
requested verification succeed:

```text
COPY A0:*.COM D0:[$RW,!$ARC]
```

This requests writable destination copies with ARC clear. Unspecified attributes
are preserved. Opposite assignments such as `[$RO,$RW]` are invalid before writes; repeated
equivalent assignments are harmless. Destination qualifiers are comma-separated
state assignments, not Boolean expressions with AND or OR. Existing
read-only destinations remain protected, even when `[$RW]` is requested.

`/BACKUP` takes precedence over destination ARC settings and clears ARC after
success, including when the destination says `[$ARC]`. Skipped, failed and
aborted copies retain source ARC. If data copying succeeds but an attribute
update fails, COPY reports incomplete backup-status handling.

If a source read or destination write/close fails, COPY reports the file and
removes its incomplete destination before continuing to later files. Disk full
stops the batch. If removal fails, `INCOMPLETE DESTINATION CLEANUP FAILED`
means the incomplete file may remain; COPY stops. Earlier completed copies
remain available, and the failed file retains its source ARC status.

Both operand orders support source and destination qualifiers:

```text
COPY B2:*.DOC[$ARC] C0:[!$ARC] /V
COPY /V C0:[!$ARC]=B2:*.DOC[$ARC]
```

Leading and trailing slash options have the same command-wide scope. They do
not become destination options merely by appearing at the end.

Automatic ARC setting when a file changes is a separate proposal. Until that
exists, the user or another tool must explicitly maintain ARC status; do not
assume this facility automatically discovers all changed files.


#### 4.7 MOVE — Move Files

Moves one or more files to another name, drive, or user area.

`MOVE` is available as a resident command and supports syntax parallel to
`COPY`:

    MOVE source destination
    MOVE destination:=source

Examples:

    A>MOVE README.TXT B:
    A>MOVE *.BAK B:
    A>MOVE A3:*.ASM B17:
    A>MOVE B:README.TXT:=README.TXT
    A>MOVE B3:BACKUP.COM:=A2:ORIGINAL.COM

Wildcards may be used to move groups of files. Drive and user-area
specifications may be used with the source and destination without changing
the current drive/user.

When the source and destination are on different drives or in different user
areas, BetterCP/M copies each file to its destination and removes the source
only after the destination has been successfully written and closed.

Resident MOVE uses the same copy engine even within one DU, followed by source
deletion after the destination closes and its attributes have been applied.
If source deletion fails, it reports `COPY MADE; SOURCE NOT ERASED`. An
unexpected execution failure stops the invocation; earlier completed files are
not rolled back.

[TBD — determine whether BetterCP/M 1.0 will also provide a transient
`MOVE.COM` and, if so, document its additional functions here.]

#### 4.8 CLS — Clear Screen

Clears the console screen and returns the cursor to the upper-left corner.

Syntax:

    CLS

Example:

    A>CLS

`CLS` is supplied as a resident command by `RCP.CPX`. A matching transient
`CLS.COM` is also provided so that the command remains available when the
resident command package is not loaded.

The exact screen-clearing operation is provided by the active console
environment and may differ between supported platforms.

#### 4.9 VER — Display Version Information

Displays BetterCP/M version information.

Syntax:

    VER

Example:

    A>VER

`VER` is supplied as a resident command by `RCP.CPX`. It identifies the
running BetterCP/M system and its release version.

`VER /V` adds subsystem version details. `:VER /BANNER` prints the introductory
sign-on banner used by the distribution startup script. These options must be
used alone. The banner is supplied by VER.COM; resident `VER /BANNER` reports
`VER: Use :VER.`.

#### 4.10 SAVE — Save Memory to a File

Saves the contents of the Transient Program Area to a file.

`SAVE` is a core resident command and supports the standard CP/M 2.2 syntax:

    SAVE pages filespec

where `pages` is the number of 256-byte pages to save, beginning at address
0100H.

Examples:

    A>SAVE 10 TEST.COM
    A>SAVE 40 B:PROGRAM.COM
    A>SAVE 20 B3:IMAGE.COM

For example:

    A>SAVE 10 TEST.COM

writes 10 pages, or 2560 bytes, beginning at 0100H to `TEST.COM`.

`SAVE` is implemented directly by the BetterCP/M command processor rather than
as a transient program. A transient `SAVE.COM` could overwrite the memory that
SAVE is intended to preserve.

BetterCP/M extends the conventional command to permit drive/user-qualified
destination file specifications.

#### 4.11 GET — Load a File into Memory

Loads a file into memory without executing it.

Syntax:

    GET filename
    GET address filename

With one operand, `GET` loads the file beginning at address 0100H:

    A>GET PROGRAM.COM

An optional hexadecimal address specifies another load address:

    A>GET 8000 DATA.BIN

Leading zeroes in the address are optional.

`GET` returns to the command prompt after loading the file. It does not execute
the loaded image. The loaded program or data can subsequently be examined or
modified with `PEEK` and `POKE`, or executed with `GO` or `JUMP`.

`GET` rejects a load that would overwrite memory required by the active
BetterCP/M command environment.


#### 4.12 GO — Execute at 0100H

Transfers control to address 0100H.

Syntax:

    GO [command tail]

Examples:

    A>GO
    A>GO INPUT.DAT

`GO` is equivalent to:

    JUMP 0100

Before transferring control, BetterCP/M establishes the normal CP/M transient
program environment, including the stack, DMA address, page-zero vectors,
command tail, and default FCBs.

`GO` is useful for executing a program image previously loaded or modified in
memory with commands such as `GET` and `POKE`.


#### 4.13 JUMP — Execute at an Address

Transfers control to a specified memory address.

Syntax:

    JUMP address [command tail]

where `address` is a hexadecimal address from 0000H through FFFFH.

Examples:

    A>JUMP 100
    A>JUMP 8000
    A>JUMP 100 INPUT.DAT

Before transferring control, `JUMP` establishes the normal CP/M transient
program environment, including the stack, DMA address, page-zero vectors,
command tail, and default FCBs.

`GO` is equivalent to `JUMP 0100`.

If no address is supplied, or the address is invalid, `JUMP` reports an error
and returns to the command prompt.


#### 4.14 PEEK / P — Display Memory

Displays the contents of memory in hexadecimal and ASCII form.

`P` is an abbreviation for `PEEK`.

Syntax:

    PEEK
    PEEK address
    PEEK first last

or:

    P
    P address
    P first last

Examples:

    A>PEEK 100
    A>P 8000
    A>PEEK 100 1FF

With one address, `PEEK` displays 256 bytes beginning at that address. With two
addresses, it displays the inclusive range from `first` through `last`.

With no address, the first invocation begins at 0100H. Subsequent invocations
continue from the byte following the previous display.

During a paged display:

    SPACE  .  >     display the next page
           ,  <     display the previous page
       Ctrl-C       return to the command prompt

Addresses are hexadecimal and may be written without leading zeroes. The
display does not wrap from FFFFH to 0000H.


#### 4.15 POKE — Modify Memory

Stores bytes or text directly into memory.

Syntax:

    POKE address byte [byte ...]
    POKE address "text
    POKE address byte [byte ...] "text

where `address` and byte values are hexadecimal.

Examples:

    A>POKE 100 C3 00 80
    A>POKE 200 "Hello
    A>POKE 300 0D 0A "BetterCP/M

Bytes are stored consecutively beginning at the specified address. A quotation
mark introduces literal text; all remaining characters on the command line are
stored as text.

`POKE` validates the address and all hexadecimal byte operands before modifying
memory. If an operand is invalid, no partial modification is performed.

`POKE`, together with `GET`, `PEEK`, `GO`, `JUMP`, and `SAVE`, provides a small
resident set of memory inspection, modification, loading, execution, and saving
commands.

#### 4.16 STAT — Extended DU File Inspection

STAT accepts extended DU selectors when reporting file statistics:

    STAT B[3,5]:*.COM
    STAT B[5-3]:*.DAT $S
    STAT B[-]:*.COM
    STAT [A0,C[3,5,7-11],5]:*.DAT

A drive's bracketed list selects users on that drive. `[-]` selects users
0–31; open endpoints and descending ranges are accepted. Compound lists
combine locations. A user-only term inherits the caller's original drive;
a drive-only term inherits the original user. Duplicate locations are visited
once, in drive-major/user-minor order. `[*]` is invalid as a user selector.
Filename wildcards retain the bounded 8.3 rules.

Each location has a DU heading, and every file result includes its DU. Empty
locations report `File Not Found`. An unavailable drive is identified and
inspection continues with the remaining locations. The caller's drive and
user are restored on completion.

An explicit filename or pattern is required after an extended selector.
`$S` adds logical file size. Extended selectors currently support inspection
only: attribute options and drive-wide commands such as `DSK:` and `=R/O`
are rejected. Conventional single-DU STAT commands retain their existing
behavior and output.

#### 4.17 ED — Context Editor

ED is the standard CP/M 2.2 context editor, reimplemented for BetterCP/M with
drive/user addressing. It edits one text file at a time through commands at the
`*` prompt. It is a line-oriented editor; it does not provide a full-screen
interface or cursor-key navigation.

ED.COM is included on both generated System Disks. Release-wide validation
continues; see the ED engineering qualification record for test coverage and
limits.

##### Starting ED

```text
ED filespec
ED filespec output-du:
ED /VER
```

| Example | Source | Output/work location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ED NOTES.TXT` | Current drive/user | Source DU |
| `ED B:NOTES.TXT` | B, current user | Source DU |
| `ED B7:NOTES.TXT` | B, user 7 | B7 |
| `ED 7:NOTES.TXT` | Current drive, user 7 | Source DU |
| `ED B7:NOTES.TXT C3:` | B, user 7 | C3 |
| `ED B:NOTES.TXT 7:` | B, current user | Caller’s drive, user 7 |

Drive letters accept either case. Users are 0–31. Omitted drive/user parts of
invocation operands refer to the DU at the time ED was started. Without a second
operand, the source DU is also the output/work DU. The second operand is a
location ending in `:`, not a replacement filename.

ED requires one exact 8.3 filename. Wildcards, DU sets and attribute qualifiers
are invalid: `*.TXT`, `B[-]:NOTES.TXT` and `NOTES.TXT[$RO]` cannot be edited.

##### How editing works

ED reads source text into a working buffer. Commands move the current position,
show text and change that buffer. The buffer need not hold the entire file.
Text already written goes into a work file; unread text remains in the source.
An existing source is not automatically loaded into the buffer when ED starts.

For a new file, enter `I` and press Enter at ED’s prompt. Type the text, pressing
Enter after each line. Press Ctrl-Z to leave insert mode. Enter `B` to return to
the beginning of the buffer, then `T` to display the current line. Enter `E` on
its own to finish and save.

For an existing file, `1A` brings in one source line. `B` returns to the buffer’s
beginning and `T` displays a line. Load further text with `A` as needed. For a
large file, work in portions using `A` and `W`; loading the whole file can exceed
the buffer. `E` finishes the edit, including remaining source text as required.

##### Command reference

Most commands accept a count before their letter. For example, `5L` moves
forward five lines and `-2L` moves back two. Counts and signs are command-specific:
zero does not have one universal meaning. `#` is ED’s large-count notation.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `A` | Read source lines into the buffer |
| `B`, `-B` | Move to the buffer’s beginning or end |
| `C` | Move by characters |
| `D` | Delete characters |
| `K` | Delete lines |
| `L` | Move by lines |
| `n:` | Move to absolute line `n` within the buffered text |
| `T` | Display text lines |
| `P` | Move and display pages |
| Enter | Move/type using ED’s carriage-return command |
| `I` | Insert text |
| `F` | Find a string in the buffer |
| `N` | Search onward through the file |
| `S` | Replace a matching string |
| `J` | Find, insert and remove text between specified strings |
| `M` | Repeat an ED command sequence |
| `R` | Insert text from a library file |
| `X` | Transfer text through ED’s temporary library |
| `U`, `-U` | Enable or disable uppercase translation |
| `V`, `-V` | Enable or disable line-number verification |
| `0V` | Show buffer use/capacity |
| `W` | Write buffered lines to the work output |
| `Z` | Delay, principally within macros |
| `E` | Finish, save and exit |
| `H` | Save and restart editing from the head |
| `O` | Abandon changes and resume from the original |
| `Q` | Quit without committing the edit |

Absolute line references use file line numbers, including lines already written
out of memory. For example, `3:` moves to line 3, and `:3T` displays from the
current position through line 3 when that line is ahead. They operate only on
buffered text; they do not reload earlier text. Commands can follow a reference
on the same line, such as `3:2C`.

Counted `J` applies each iteration independently. This corrects a DRI bug that
could duplicate text between iterations. If a later match is missing, completed
edits remain and ED reports the search failure.

For `M`, counts of 0, 1 or an omitted count repeat until a command fails or
you interrupt. A larger count runs that many iterations, then reports the
historical `#` break. Macro bodies form a continuous command stream; terminate
inserted/search strings with Ctrl-Z. Macros cannot nest.

`P` moves by 23 lines and displays a page; `0P` displays from the current
position. `Z` uses the historical CPU-timed delay, so its nominal half-second
unit runs faster on accelerated emulators. `0Z` waits for a key; Ctrl-Z breaks
the command or macro.

Enter `E`, `H`, `O` and `Q` as standalone commands, without numeric counts or
other commands on the same line. `H` saves; `O` and `Q` abandon changes. They are
not interchangeable ways to leave the editor. `Q` asks the historical
`Q-(Y/N)?` question; answer `Y` to quit. Opening a new file creates an empty
source file, which can remain after `Q`. An older `.BAK` is removed when the
edit is initialized, so quitting preserves the original source but does not
preserve an earlier backup generation.

If saving reports `Rename failed. Edited text retained in work file.`, ED stops
and returns to the caller’s drive/user. The edited text remains in the `.$$$`
work file. The original remains under its original name if the first rename
failed, or under `.BAK` if the second failed. Preserve these files for recovery;
ED does not retry or roll back the renames. This fixes a DRI bug that could
create duplicate filenames after a failed rename.

String commands retain CP/M 2.2’s syntax. Ctrl-Z separates or terminates strings
where required; Enter can terminate a command line. Search and substitution use
literal strings, not regular expressions. Command letter case can affect string
conversion; do not assume that changing an entire command line to uppercase is
harmless. Insert-mode editing controls retain their historical ED meanings.

##### Reading library text

`R` reads one library file, inserting its text into the buffer. The historical
`.LIB` convention remains. A library filename can use a simple DU, for example:

```text
RB7:HEADER.LIB
R7:HEADER.LIB
```

An unqualified name uses the source DU; an omitted extension defaults to `.LIB`.
Terminate the filename using ED’s ordinary command/string syntax. A user-only
location names the caller’s drive and the specified user. Library reads do not
accept ranges, wildcards or lists. `X` retains ED’s separate temporary-library
facility; it is not a general copy command.

Bare `R` reads the transfer library, including its pending buffered text.
For historical compatibility, uppercase `R` translates disk-record text but
copies the pending transfer tail unchanged.

Transfers remain available across `O` and `H`, including split-DU restarts.
An active transfer stays in the DU where it was created until `0X` or exit
cleans it up. This fixes DRI bugs that could corrupt pending text, lose the
transfer lookup or leave an orphan transfer file after a split-drive restart.

##### Saving, backups and protection

For a same-DU edit of `B7:NOTES.TXT`, the work file is `B7:NOTES.$$$`. A successful
`E` replaces the source with the edited result and keeps the former source as
`B7:NOTES.BAK`. Only ED’s historical backup generation is kept; an existing
`.BAK` can be removed as part of ED’s historical file workflow. Keep any backup
you need under another name before editing.

With alternate output, the edited result goes to the specified output/work DU,
while the old source is backed up in its source DU. An existing final filename
in an alternate output DU is rejected rather than silently replaced. ED adds no
overwrite prompt, force switch or numbered-backup facility.

RO and SYS files retain the original ED protection behavior. ED does not clear
attributes automatically and does not accept attribute selectors or overrides.
Quitting or interrupting an edit does not commit it; temporary-file leftovers
follow historical ED behavior. Disk-full, directory-full and command errors use
ED’s original recovery rules and diagnostics, including `BREAK` messages.

Do not assume ED always restores the DU from which it was invoked. Exit-location
behavior follows DRI ED and extends to the output user area. Exact exit DU and
error details will be documented after reference qualification.

##### Version identification

```text
ED /VER
BetterCP/M ED 1.0 (Build nnn)
```

`nnn` is the assigned ED build number. `/VER` must appear alone; it is invalid
with a filename or output DU, and is not an editing command at the `*` prompt.

#### 4.18 PIP — Peripheral Interchange Program

PIP provides the traditional CP/M transfer interface, including concatenation,
character devices and text transformations. Use destination-first assignment:

```text
PIP destination=source
PIP destination=source1,source2
PIP B:=A:*.COM
PIP B3:REPORT.TXT=A7:REPORT.TXT
```

PIP without a command tail opens a `*` prompt for successive assignments.
An empty input line exits. `PIP /VER` currently prints
`BetterCP/M PIP 1.0 (Build 026)` and exits; it must be used alone.

Each disk operand inherits the invocation’s drive and user unless qualified.
Single DU forms and user-only forms are supported, with users 0–31. Historical
`[Gn]` selects a source user; do not combine it with an explicit user on the
same operand. Compound DU selectors and COPY-style attribute expressions are
not PIP syntax. PIP keeps its historical wildcard rules.

Text copying and concatenation stop each source at Ctrl-Z. Object mode `[O]`
and automatic COM-file handling provide physical-record copying where the
historical dispatch rules apply. In a single file-to-file transfer using S/Q,
`[O]` on a text-named source does not override text EOF; COM sources and the
concatenation/device paths follow the separately qualified DRI behavior.

Put transfer parameters on the affected source:

```text
PIP B:OUT.TXT=A:IN.TXT[UV]
PIP B:JOIN.TXT=A:ONE.TXT,A:TWO.TXT
PIP LST:=README.TXT[NT8]
```

| Parameter | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| B | Block-mode input buffering |
| Dn | Limit output columns |
| E | Echo transfer to the console |
| F | Filter input form feeds |
| Gn | Read from user n |
| H / I | Intel HEX processing / suppress zero-length records |
| L / U | Convert to lowercase / uppercase |
| N / N2 | Number lines |
| O | Object transfer |
| Pn | Page ejects; P or P1 uses 60 lines |
| Qs / Ss | Quit at / start at a string |
| R | Include SYS sources |
| Tn | Expand tabs to n-column stops |
| V | Verify disk output |
| W | Authorize replacement of a read-only destination |
| Z | Clear input parity/high bits |

S/Q strings require an actual Ctrl-Z byte as their terminator. They are not
terminated by the two printable characters `^Z`. HEX processing retains DRI’s
bounded record and interactive correction behavior.

Logical devices are CON, RDR, PUN and LST. Physical aliases depend on the target:

| Target | Available physical aliases |
| --- | --- |
| Model 4 | CRT |
| cpmsim | TTY, CRT, PTR, PTP, LPT, PRN |

PRN selects LPT and applies DRI’s line-numbering, default T8 and default
60-line pagination. Unsupported physical aliases, including IRD and user
devices without a backend, report `DEVICE UNAVAILABLE` before transfer I/O.
On the routed BIOS, unavailable logical selections are likewise refused.
INP/OUT retain their historical patch entries; NUL and EOF are special sources.

Physical-device calls temporarily select their endpoint and restore IOBYTE on
return. Cooked console input retains DRI’s fatal Ctrl-C warm-boot behavior:
that nonreturning path does not perform ordinary PIP cleanup or restore the
interrupted per-call assignment. Normal transfer polling uses the qualified
cleanup paths. Avoid treating character-device calls as a recoverable disk-I/O
error interface. cpmsim auxiliary input/output uses the host’s configured pipe
or file facilities; a missing host input is not a portable recoverable error.

Disk output uses a temporary file and guarded replacement. Read/write,
verification and replacement failures are reported; a failed command cancels
an active SUBMIT queue where permitted. This is not power-loss atomicity.
PIP follows its DRI attribute behavior rather than COPY’s ARC policy; use COPY
for the BetterCP/M backup workflow.

See the [PIP engineering specification](../engineering/PIP%20Specification.md)
for detailed compatibility cases and qualification limits.

### 5. Batch Processing
5.1 SUBMIT 5.2 SUB Files 5.3 Parameters and Substitution 5.4 XSUB 5.5 Batch Execution and Termination 5.6 Examples

#### XSUB after batch input ends

XSUB supplies submitted lines to programs using buffered console input. Once
its batch queue ends, input comes from your keyboard and the same program
continues normally. A malformed queue is discarded before console fallback.

BATCHIO may remain listed after the batch ends. It retires when an idle provider
receives an explicit BDOS Function 0 warm boot. Programs returning directly
through the BIOS may leave it loaded. To reclaim its memory explicitly, use:

    RSX UNLOAD BATCHIO

With no other RSXs loaded, unloading restores 53K TPA.

#### 5.7 COPY in Batch Files

A SUBMIT file executes a sequence of commands; it does not automatically make
those commands noninteractive. A COPY command in a SUBMIT file may pause for
an overwrite response. Use `/B` explicitly when the command must run without
collision prompts.

For example, a SUBMIT file may contain:

    COPY B1:*.DAT C3: /B

If a writable destination exists, `/B` alone reports `FILE EXISTS`, counts
that file as failed, and continues with the next source. It does not overwrite
or silently skip that file. New destination files are copied normally.

To choose a collision policy in advance:

    COPY B1:*.DAT C3: /B /O
    COPY B1:*.DAT C3: /B /S

The first command replaces existing writable destinations. The second skips
existing writable destinations. Both copy files whose destinations do not
already exist. A read-only destination fails that file and is preserved in
all three forms; processing continues with later files.

`/B` works equally at the command prompt. It does not change SUBMIT itself,
make the whole script noninteractive, or suppress prompts from other programs.
The mapping and capacity checks in section 4.6 still apply before any writes.

### 6. CPX and RSX Extensions
6.1 BetterCP/M Extensions 6.2 CPXs 6.3 Listing CPXs 6.4 Loading and Unloading CPXs 6.5 RSXs 6.6 Listing RSXs 6.7 Loading and Unloading RSXs 6.8 Extension Order and Memory Use 6.9 Warm Boot and Extension Persistence 6.10 Recovery
This should be user-oriented throughout.

#### 6.10 Recovering from an unusable CPX

If an optional CPX file cannot be loaded or fails validation, BetterCP/M prints
`CPX?` and continues to the command prompt with the other usable extensions.
The rejected extension's commands are unavailable. Its name remains in the
configured profile, so `CPX LIST` can still show it; this does not mean it
loaded successfully. Remove it with, for example:

```text
CPX UNLOAD BAD
```

Alternatively, replace the damaged carrier with a valid copy. Until the entry
is removed or repaired, the warning can recur when the command environment is
reloaded after programs run. A missing optional CPX file is skipped without
that warning. This recovery does not cover a damaged required command
processor or an unreadable boot disk.

### 7. Configuring BetterCP/M

#### 7.1 CONFIG — Current configuration utility

Run `CONFIG` to enter the console menu. `CONFIG /VER` displays the utility’s
version and build number; it must be used alone. CONFIG works without a monitor
RSX or a full-screen terminal.

The menu groups startup settings first, followed by disk definitions and saving:

```text
[ A ] Startup command

[ B ] Cold-boot IOBYTE

[ C ] Disk drive definitions
[ D ] Disk format definitions
[ E ] Create or edit a disk format

[ S ] Save current configuration on disk (SYSGEN)
```

Select A–E or S, or press BREAK (^C) to exit. Keyboard, video, printer and
serial placeholders are not displayed.

CONFIG currently provides drive configuration, startup-command editing, saved
disk-boot IOBYTE assignment, and save operations. It distinguishes the settings in use now, pending changes,
and defaults saved for subsequent startup. Changing a live setting does not
necessarily change its saved default.

The save menu offers two scopes: save pending cold-boot changes only, or save
all current settings as startup defaults. Choose the first to preserve saved
drive defaults when a current drive setting is only temporary. Choose the
second when the current settings should become the defaults. CONFIG verifies
writes and attempts restoration after recoverable save failures. A power loss
during saving can still require recovery.

Use `CONFIG /SHOW` for read-only inspection of active physical profiles, active
logical bindings, the saved cold-start command, and saved drive defaults. Active
and saved drive settings are listed separately: a temporary active change need
not match the next cold-boot default. It reports no private pending changes for
the new invocation. Inspection never asks for save confirmation.

CONFIG validates the installed system's layout, geometry and fixed bytes before
showing saved drive settings or saving all settings. Build 005 uses an embedded
CRC-32 fingerprint; no SYSGEN.DAT file is needed. If the system does not match,
CONFIG reports the problem instead of showing unverified saved drive defaults
or writing a configuration. Use CONFIG from the matching system build.

The CRC detects accidental corruption or a mismatched build; it is not a
cryptographic authenticity check. Editable configuration fields are excluded,
so a previously saved drive configuration remains valid.

Physical drive fields can also be changed from the command line:

```text
CONFIG /PHYSICAL=1 /TRACKS=80 /SIDES=2 /STEP=6
```

Specify physical drive `0`–`3` first, then one or more of these fields:

| Field | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `/TYPE=` | 5 or 8 inches |
| `/TRACKS=` | 35, 40, 77 or 80 |
| `/SIDES=` | 1 or 2 |
| `/STEP=` | 6, 12, 20 or 30 milliseconds |
| `/SPINUP=` | 0–16 quarter-seconds |
| `/SETTLE=` | 0–255 milliseconds |

Unspecified fields retain their current values. Duplicate fields, invalid values
and extra operands are rejected before changes. These commands apply live
settings and return immediately; they do not save boot defaults or ask for a
save confirmation. To make a change persistent, use CONFIG's save-all-current
menu separately. Physical timing effects depend on the platform.

A change that cannot support A:'s current track/side requirements is rejected.
Incompatible bindings on other logical drives are unconfigured after a physical
profile changes, as with the menu. If CONFIG reports “Drive profile changed;
binding cleanup incomplete,” the profile has changed but some binding checks or
changes failed; retry or inspect and correct the affected logical bindings.

To assign a catalogue format to a logical drive:

```text
CONFIG /LOGICAL=C /PHYSICAL=1 /FORMAT="MM 80T DS DATA"
```

Use the exact format description displayed by CONFIG's format-selection menu,
inside double quotes. Matching ignores letter case. Unknown or ambiguous names,
unsupported formats, and incompatible physical geometry are rejected without
changing the binding. The entire command is checked before catalogue access.
The format catalogue must be available on the current drive or A:.

To detach a logical drive without erasing its media:

```text
CONFIG /LOGICAL=C /UNBIND
```

Both commands accept B–D; A: is protected. These change active state only and
reset the selected drive's login/allocation information. They return without a
confirmation or completion prompt. Save all current settings separately if the
binding should survive cold boot. `/UNBIND` does not require DISK.FDB. A named
binding with a missing or corrupt catalogue reports the error and returns.

To adjust individual fields of an existing active format binding:

```text
CONFIG /EDIT=B /CKS=16
```

Use B–D. Named scalar fields include `SPT`, `BSH`, `BLM`, `EXM`, `DSM`,
`DRM`, `AL0`, `AL1`, `CKS`, `OFF`, `CYLINDERS`, `SECTORS`, `SIZE`, `FLAGS`,
`SIZEMAP`, and `PHYSICAL`. Values are unsigned decimal; each field may appear
once. CONFIG preserves unspecified fields and rejects unsupported combinations.
These are expert format-definition controls: they change how existing media is
interpreted, so use values appropriate to its actual format. They do not format
or erase the disk. Changes are active only; save separately to retain them.
No format catalogue is needed. Sector slots can also be edited directly:

```text
CONFIG /EDIT=B /SLOT=1 /ID=200
CONFIG /EDIT=B /SPT=35 /SLOT=1 /CODE=0
```

`SLOT` is physical order 1–32; `ID` is 0–255; `CODE` is 0–3 for
128/256/512/1024-byte sectors. Edit one slot per command, supplying an ID, size
code, or both. Size edits require FDF.RSX and consistent SPT/size settings; CONFIG
rejects unsupported or inconsistent requests. The example values illustrate
syntax, not a format suitable for every disk. The first size edit seeds the
remaining slots from the uniform size. Duplicate IDs are rejected; menu E lets
you prepare several private edits before applying the complete map together.

#### 7.2 Startup command

Use CONFIG’s startup-command menu (`A`) to inspect or edit the pending command.
Editing it does not execute it or save it automatically. Use the save menu to
make the change persistent. An empty command disables automatic startup.

To prepare the default startup command:

```text
CONFIG /DEFAULT
```

This prepares `SUBMIT STARTUP` as an **unsaved pending command**, then opens
CONFIG's startup menu. Drive settings remain unchanged. It does not run the
command or alter STARTUP.SUB. Inspect or edit it, then use H to save it with the
normal confirmation. Exiting without saving discards the pending replacement.

Command-line startup editing is also available:

```text
CONFIG /STARTUP="SUBMIT STARTUP"
CONFIG /STARTUP=""
```

These forms ask for the existing save confirmation, then save and verify only
the startup command for the next cold boot. They do not execute it or save
current drive settings. Answering N leaves the disk unchanged. Text inside
quotes is preserved as command data, including `/VER`.

Distribution disks default to `SUBMIT STARTUP`. The command runs once at cold
boot; ordinary warm boot does not repeat it. Development and test images may
have startup disabled. The supplied A0:STARTUP.SUB invokes `:VER /BANNER`.
Edit that script to add ordinary startup commands such as loading an RSX.

#### 7.3 Drive configuration

CONFIG uses DISK.FDB to select available format definitions; it is not a format
database editor. Drive settings and activation rules depend on the platform.
Keep current settings separate from saved boot defaults, and follow the menu’s
validation and save results before relying on a new configuration.

#### Saved disk-boot device assignment

STAT changes the live IOBYTE. To save a separate value for the next disk cold
boot, use CONFIG menu B or:

```text
CONFIG /IOBYTE=85
```

Values are **decimal**: 85 (55h) selects CRT console, PTR reader, PTP punch and
CRT list. 149 (95h) restores BetterCP/M's compiled assignment, with LPT list.
`CONFIG /SHOW` displays both the live and saved bytes. The command requires Y
before saving, verifies the write and attempts restoration on an ordinary
failure. It does not change the live assignment; STAT remains the live control.
`/DEFAULT` does not reset this saved byte.

The console must remain CRT, and changed device routes must be supported by the
platform. Retaining a compiled placeholder route does not implement its device.
The value is stored in this disk's boot code. It applies to subsequent disk
boots, not to an immutable ROM's default. If power is lost during the boot-sector
write, recovery from another boot disk may be necessary.

#### 7.4 Planned extensions — not yet implemented

The [CONFIG engineering specification](../engineering/CONFIG%20Specification.md)
records the runtime and backend gates for remaining proposals. Drive workbench
CLI and startup-only `/DEFAULT` are implemented as described above.

Printer tab/line-ending/form-feed policies and serial-port configuration are
deferred to post-1.0. CONFIG 1.0 offers no printer-transformation or serial-settings
menu entries or command-line switches. Existing auxiliary I/O remains available.
STAT remains the utility for live IOBYTE assignments; CONFIG retains saved
disk-boot IOBYTE configuration.

CONFIG does not manage keyboard mappings, monitor personalities, clocks, or
RSX loading and unloading. Use the dedicated subsystem utilities and startup
scripts for those facilities. Search paths and named directories remain
post-1.0 work.

### 8. Disk Operations

#### 8.1 DUP — Format, copy, and check disks

`DUP` operates on disks rather than individual files. Run it to open the menu:

```text
DUP
    A  Format a disk
    B  Copy a disk
    C  Check a disk for errors
```

Use BREAK (`Ctrl-C`) to exit the main menu. At drive-selection prompts,
`Ctrl-C` returns to the menu. Direct command-line operations are also available:

```text
DUP /FORMAT B:
DUP /COPY A: B:
DUP /CHECK C:
```

These forms use the same operation engines and drive restrictions. FORMAT
and COPY still require `Y/N` confirmation; there is no unattended bypass.
CHECK needs no confirmation. Direct operations return to the CCP after
completion, refusal, interruption, or failure, with required cleanup completed.
If binding restoration fails, its retry prompt remains interactive.

`DUP /VER` displays the utility identity and exits. Its current output is
`BetterCP/M DUP 1.0 (Build 002)`. The older version number in the interactive
menu title is separate from this release/build identity.

DUP requires about 51K of available transient memory. If loaded extensions
leave insufficient room, it reports that requirement without beginning an
operation.

#### 8.2 Choose the correct drive and format

DUP uses the format already assigned to a logical drive. It does not offer a
format catalogue; use CONFIG to establish the required binding first. Check
the displayed logical and physical drives before confirming any operation.

The current interface selects drives A through D. FORMAT and COPY destination
writes are prohibited on physical drive 0, the protected system drive. This
protection follows the physical drive even when logical letters are remapped.
CHECK may read it, and COPY may use it as a source.

A format listed in DISK.FDB is not necessarily supported for formatting by
both backends. DUP reports unsupported operations rather than substituting a
different format. The qualified z80pack mixed-sector formatting rejection
leaves the target unchanged; do not assume this guarantee covers every backend
failure.

#### 8.3 Format a disk

Choose `A`, then the logical drive A–D. FORMAT uses that drive’s assigned
format. After validation, DUP warns that all data on the physical target disk
will be lost and asks for `Y/N` confirmation. Only `Y` proceeds.

Formatting creates tracks and immediately rereads their data to verify the
expected erased contents. Success reports the written and verified track
count and `Format complete.` A write or verification failure stops the
operation. Write-track retries are bounded; write protection is not retried.

`Ctrl-C` stops between bounded operations. An aborted disk is only partly
formatted and must not be treated as successfully prepared.

#### 8.4 Copy a disk

Choose `B`, select a source A–D and a destination B–D. COPY requires two
different physical drives; it does not support single-drive disk swapping.
The source is read only. Physical drive 0 cannot be the destination.

If the destination’s assigned format matches the source, DUP copies without
reformatting. If it differs, DUP reports that it will format the destination
to match the source and validates a temporary destination binding. Confirm
only after checking both physical drives: destination contents will be erased.

COPY includes all sector payloads represented by the source binding, including
system areas, directories, deleted-file data, and free space. It is not a
flux-level or arbitrary track-image clone and does not preserve unrepresented
physical artifacts such as weak sectors or deleted-data address marks.

Each source surface is read before its corresponding destination surface is
overwritten. DUP then rereads the destination and compares its bytes with the
buffered source. Success is reported as:

```text
Copy complete; destination verified.
```

When a temporary destination binding was used, DUP restores the old
configuration. This does not undo the physical disk’s new format. Use CONFIG
to assign the copied format before normal access to that medium, and save it
if it should become the startup default.

A failed or interrupted copy may leave the destination partly written. COPY
stops after data errors rather than continuing with unreliable contents.

#### 8.5 Check a disk

Choose `C`, then a drive A–D. CHECK reads the sectors represented by the current
binding without changing their contents. It checks physical readability;
it does not repair the filesystem or compare against another disk.

Ordinary read errors are reported with physical location information and
checking continues. A bad physical sector is counted once, even when it
contains several logical records. Completion reports:

```text
Check complete. Unreadable sectors: n
```

`Ctrl-C` stops checking without changing disk contents. Errors that prevent
meaningful continued operation may terminate the check.

#### 8.6 Errors and cleanup

DUP reports errors such as drive not ready, write protection, missing sectors,
CRC failures, unsupported operations, and read-back mismatches. An error or
interruption is not successful completion.

Temporary COPY bindings are restored before returning to normal operation.
If restoration fails, DUP asks for a key to retry and retains the saved
configuration. Follow that recovery path; it has not yet completed cleanup.

The [DUP engineering specification](../engineering/DUP%20Specification.md)
records the detailed behavior and qualified backend boundaries.

### 9. Date and Time
9.1 BetterCP/M Clock Support 9.2 TIME 9.3 Displaying the Date and Time 9.4 Setting the Date and Time 9.5 Read-Only Clock Providers 9.6 P2DOS Compatibility
Probably a relatively short chapter.

### 10. Installing BetterCP/M

#### 10.1 What SYSGEN installs

`SYSGEN` installs BetterCP/M into an already prepared disk’s reserved system
area. It does not format the disk or copy distribution utilities into its
filesystem. Use CONFIG and DUP to establish a compatible format when preparation
is needed. Formatting with DUP erases data; installing with SYSGEN preserves
records outside its system-area write range.

The installed system payload is 160 records (20,480 bytes). A SYSTEM.SYS package
contains a separate header plus that payload: 161 records (20,608 bytes).
The package header is not written into the installed system area.

#### 10.2 Select the source and destination

Supported forms are:

```text
SYSGEN
SYSGEN source: destination:
SYSGEN [drive:]package destination:
SYSGEN source: [drive:]package
SYSGEN source:
SYSGEN /VER
```

With no operands, SYSGEN takes its system image from A: and prompts for a
destination B:–D:. For explicit disk-source installation, the source is A:–D:
and the destination is B:–D:, for example:

```text
SYSGEN A: B:
SYSGEN C: D:
```

Source and destination must resolve to different physical drives. Physical
drive 0 is protected from destination writes even if logical letters are
remapped.

To install from a package, use SYSTEM.SYS or another exact 8.3 filename:

```text
SYSGEN SYSTEM.SYS B:
SYSGEN C:SYSTEM.SYS B:
```

A drive-qualified package name is supported; a DU form such as
`B7:SYSTEM.SYS` is not part of this interface. Wildcards and selectors are not
accepted; named packages such as `B:BASE090.SYS` are supported. The complete package is buffered before writing, so package mode
does not require its source drive to be physically different from the target.
Destination restrictions still apply.

`SYSGEN /VER` currently prints `BetterCP/M SYSGEN 1.0 (Build 004)` and exits
without installation. It must be used alone.

#### 10.3 Validate and confirm installation

The target needs compatible bootstrap geometry and at least 160 reserved
logical records. It may have a larger filesystem or additional reserved
records. A true data-only format without a compatible system area is refused;
SYSGEN cannot create that area or convert its geometry.

SYSGEN validates destination compatibility before requesting confirmation.
It fully buffers and patches the source before the first destination write:

```text
The destination system area will be replaced.
Files outside the reserved system tracks will be preserved.
Proceed (Y/N)?
```

Check the displayed logical and physical target before answering. Only `Y`
begins writing. Command-line installation still requires this confirmation;
it is not unattended, and there is no confirmation-bypass switch.

Package validation checks the expected header and exact length, complete
readability, and suitability for the destination. It does not verify a
whole-payload checksum or guarantee detection of every possible corruption.
Use a trusted system package.

#### 10.4 Installation and existing files

SYSGEN patches its buffered image for the destination, writes records 1–159,
and writes boot record 0 last. Every written record is immediately reread and
compared byte for byte. Only complete verification produces:

```text
System installed and verified. The destination is bootable.
```

SYSGEN writes only the 160 payload records. Filesystem records and extra
reserved records beyond that range remain unchanged. It does not install
COM utilities or other files; those require separate file copying.

#### 10.5 Interruption and recovery

BREAK (`Ctrl-C`) exits the interactive drive prompt without writing. During
installation it stops between bounded record operations. An interruption or
I/O failure can leave a partial system area, and the destination may not boot.
SYSGEN reports the failure without claiming successful installation; its
filesystem write boundary remains unchanged.

There is no rollback of a partially installed system area. Correct the media
or source problem and repeat installation from a valid source. Writing record
0 last reduces risk but does not make installation power-loss atomic.

After successful installation, the target contains the installed boot system.
Distribution files and any desired startup script must also be present for the
intended operating environment. SYSBUILD composes new packages from build
products; SYSGEN can save installed system records as described below. There
is no separate verify-only mode; installation includes read-back verification.

#### 10.6 Save system tracks to a package

```text
SYSGEN A:
SYSGEN A: B:BASE090.SYS
SYSGEN B:BASE090.SYS C:
```

The first saves A:’s installed system as SYSTEM.SYS in your current drive/user.
The second saves a named package; the third installs it after the usual Y/N
confirmation. Different names let you keep a library of system configurations.
The snapshot includes saved settings, not unsaved live changes or ordinary files.
Export needs 36K TPA and preserves protected source records. It may store the
package in the source disk’s filesystem.

An existing ordinary package is replaced only after Y/N confirmation. RO and
SYS files are protected. SYSGEN first writes and verifies SYSGEN.$$$, then
publishes the chosen filename, using SYSGEN.BAK to retain a replaced package
until final verification succeeds. These two names are reserved for recovery;
if either already exists, export stops without overwriting it.

On success, SYSGEN reports “Package exported and verified.” If publication fails,
inspect the requested output, SYSGEN.$$$ and SYSGEN.BAK before retrying. Do not
discard a recovery file until you have checked which contains the complete
package. A failed multi-extent rename or power loss is not automatically rolled
back. Incomplete temporary-file cleanup failures are reported explicitly.

See the [SYSGEN engineering specification](../engineering/SYSGEN%20Specification.md)
for the detailed installation and qualification contracts.

### Utility version identification

Use `/VER` by itself to identify a BetterCP/M utility:

```text
A0>DIR /VER
BetterCP/M DIR 1.0 (Resident, RCP Build 001)
A0>:DIR /VER
BetterCP/M DIR 1.0 (Build 002)
```

The resident line identifies the installed RCP package. The force-transient `:DIR` form identifies DIR.COM. Transient utilities omit “Transient” from their output. Other examples include `STAT /VER`, `COPY /VER`, and `TIME /VER`.

Version identifies the release; build identifies its particular executable revision. Each utility has an independent build sequence, while resident commands share the RCP sequence. Build numbers continue across version changes and do not advance merely because the same source is rebuilt.

`/VER` prints the identity and exits without carrying out the command. Do not combine it with filespecs or other options; such combinations report `Invalid /VER usage.` Existing CPX/RSX `/V` reports facility versions and remains a separate option. This convention applies to BetterCP/M-owned utilities, not adopted third-party programs.


### RSX manager runtime container

Keep `R3PACK.RSX` on the System Disk in A0:. The RSX manager reads its
internal helper slots automatically; do not load it as an extension. It
replaces the separate R3 helper files. Keep the container matched to the
BetterCP/M system build; use the distribution builder to install both together.


### DIR /WHEREIS file-location mode

Available in DIR Build 003.

`DIR /WHEREIS` locates filenames across drives and user areas. It searches
only directories, includes system files by default, and reports each logical
file once as `DU:FILENAME`, followed by `1 MATCH` or `n MATCHES`.

```text
:DIR /WHEREIS ED.COM
:DIR /WHEREIS B:ED.COM
:DIR /WHEREIS B[-]:*.COM[$SYS]
```

The first searches all configured drives and users 0–31. The second searches
B at the current user only; the third searches all users on B, restricted to
system COM files. Only a completely unqualified operand gets global scope.
Existing DU selectors, bounded wildcards and attribute predicates apply.
Exactly one filespec is required. The option may precede or follow it.

Ordinary DIR display switches `/A`, `/P`, `/Z`, `/C=` and `/S=` cannot be
combined with `/WHEREIS`. `/VER` remains standalone-only. No paging or
confirmation prompts are specified for this mode.

No matches produces `DIR: No matches found.` If a recoverable drive or
read failure prevents a complete search, the results or no-match message are
followed by `Search incomplete.` The original DU is restored on controlled
completion. The directory search uses read-only BIOS calls to return recoverable failures
without BDOS recovery prompts. Memory-capacity failures also mark the search
incomplete.

Resident DIR reports `DIR: Use :DIR.` without automatic handoff. Retype
the full command with a leading colon or period. No separate WHEREIS.COM is
planned on the system disk.

### Resident feature guidance (1.0)

Resident commands provide basic operations using the shared file selector.
For recognized switches requiring a transient utility, they stop before any
file operation and point to explicit invocation. For example:

```text
A0>DIR /C=2
DIR: Use :DIR.
A0>:DIR /C=2
```

The message does not launch the program. Retype the complete command with a
leading colon (or period). If the program is absent, explicit invocation uses
the ordinary missing-command response. Automatic handoff and `/HANDOFF`
controls are post-1.0 work.

The recognized transient-only switches are DIR `/WHEREIS`, `/A`, `/P`, `/Z[=K|S|E]`,
`/C=1|2|4` and `/S=N|T|Z[+|-]` or `/S=U`; ERA `/Y`, `/Q`, `/C`, `/R`, `/D`;
TYPE `/7`, `/T`, `/CTL`; REN `/C`, `/Y`, `/N`, `/DRY`, `/P`, `/Q`, `/QQ`;
and COPY `/B`, `/V`, `/BACKUP`. Resident TYPE still supports `/P`; resident
COPY/MOVE keep their existing overwrite switch. `/VER` remains supported.
Unknown tokens and other invalid syntax retain ordinary resident behavior.
Selection of protected files does not itself enable destructive or override
features.


### PIP object-mode compatibility (development)

PIP is still under development and is not yet included on the System Disk.
Its O parameter retains a DRI compatibility exception worth remembering.

A single file-to-file transfer with character options such as S/Q, B or U uses
object EOF only when the source has a COM extension. O does not change that
path's EOF rule for other extensions. For example:

```text
PIP DEST.DAT=SOURCE.DAT[OU]
```

still stops SOURCE.DAT at its first Ctrl-Z byte. In a concatenation or device
transfer, O does enable object input. For example:

```text
PIP DEST.DAT=SOURCE.DAT[OU],SECOND.DAT
```

copies SOURCE.DAT through physical EOF, then appends SECOND.DAT. An O-only
direct record copy also copies physical records. HEX processing with H/I
terminates at Ctrl-Z even for object sources. These are retained DRI behaviors;
O does not universally override text EOF.

See the [PIP engineering specification](../engineering/PIP%20Specification.md)
for the qualified compatibility rules.


On INP/RDR/CON input, O also makes Ctrl-Z an ordinary data byte. A plain object
device stream has no file EOF and continues until interruption or an I/O
failure. H/I still uses HEX termination with O. INP/RDR object transfers poll
for console interruption every 256 characters; a non-Ctrl-Z key aborts through
PIP's cleanup path. CON retains its normal BDOS console-input controls.


PIP also retains DRI's source-list EOF carryover quirk: after a disk source
reaches physical EOF, a following ordinary object-mode reader fetches and
discards its first extracted character, then ends without appending reader
data. An empty disk file triggers the same behavior. Stopping a disk source at
logical Ctrl-Z does not. Another disk source resets the state; H/I reader
transfers use their own HEX termination and are unaffected.


### MM-style ADM-3A monitor

ADM3A.RSX supports the MM-style ADM-3A screen controls used by historical
Model 4 CP/M software. The same personality is supplied on both System Disks.
It uses M4SCRN.RSX on Model 4 or ANSISCRN.RSX under cpmsim with an ANSI host
terminal. Programs still need to be configured for MM-style ADM-3A controls;
unrelated hardware access is not made portable.

The Model 4 STARTUP.SUB loads M4SCRN first, then ADM3A, clears the screen and
prints the sign-on banner.
On cpmsim, startup leaves the basic console active. To select ADM3A there, run:

```text
RSX LOAD ANSISCRN
RSX LOAD ADM3A
CLS
```

Only one personality can be active. To change personalities, unload the current
one first. If the matching backend is already loaded, reuse it. Run `CLS` after loading
a personality to initialize its screen position. To recover the
53K baseline, unload ADM3A, then M4SCRN or ANSISCRN, and any other loaded RSXs.
Warm boot retains the pair. Edit STARTUP.SUB to omit automatic loading.

`ADMTST` displays control-test pages and asks for uppercase A, colon and both
brackets. Check movement, reverse video, line operations and the bell.
`ADMTST /VER` prints `BetterCP/M ADMTST 1.0 (Build 002)` without a monitor.
On the ANSI host, glyphs outside printable ASCII appear as `?` with their
reverse attribute retained. Model 4 retains its original video-byte glyphs.
With ADM3A and its backend/manager loaded, the recorded cpmsim TPA is 50K.
The Model 4 backend must match the BIOS build supplied on its disk.

### Portable VT52 monitor

VT52.RSX interprets the supported VT52 controls from an application and calls
an unloadable screen backend. The same VT52.RSX runs on both platforms:
M4SCRN.RSX renders on the Model 4 screen; ANSISCRN.RSX sends ANSI output to
cpmsim's host terminal. Use an ANSI-compatible macOS/Linux terminal with an
80-column, 24-row display area for the latter. Configure the application for
VT52 in either case.

Only one monitor personality can be active. On Model 4, first run
`RSX UNLOAD ADM3A` if the startup script loaded it. Then load the backend and
personality in that order:

```text
Model 4:  RSX LOAD M4SCRN
cpmsim:   RSX LOAD ANSISCRN

Either:   RSX LOAD VT52
          CLS
          VT52TST
```

`VT52TST` exercises identification, positioning, tab stops and erasure with
three keypress pauses. `VT52TST /VER` prints
`BetterCP/M VT52TST 1.0 (Build 002)` without requiring a loaded monitor.

Unload in the reverse order: `RSX UNLOAD VT52`, followed by
`RSX UNLOAD M4SCRN` or `RSX UNLOAD ANSISCRN`. The manager prevents removing a
backend still needed by a loaded personality. With no other RSXs loaded,
TPA returns to 53K. Startup does not automatically choose VT52. The Model 4
backend must match the BIOS build supplied on its disk.

Graphics, keypad modes and host arrow-key translation are outside this
provider's supported subset. This is not a general TCAP database or support
for arbitrary hardware; another display platform needs a compatible backend.

### ANSI/VT100 monitor

Both system disks supply the same portable ANSI.RSX personality and ANSITST.COM.
Load the platform's screen backend before ANSI. Starting with no monitor loaded:

```text
Model 4:  RSX LOAD M4SCRN
          RSX LOAD ANSI

cpmsim:   RSX LOAD ANSISCRN
          RSX LOAD ANSI
```

If the Model 4 startup has already loaded ADM3A and M4SCRN, use
`RSX UNLOAD ADM3A`, keep M4SCRN loaded, then `RSX LOAD ANSI`. Only one monitor
personality can be active. Run `CLS` before starting the application. The manager
rejects an older backend that lacks ANSI's required full-control service revision;
use the matching manager and backend supplied on the disk.

The Model 4 backend renders on its physical 80-column, 24-row screen. Under
cpmsim, use a compatible ANSI-capable macOS or Linux terminal; the host window
supplies its actual dimensions and wrapping. Model 4 displays reverse video and
conceal; other styles and colors are retained logically but have no physical
effect. Host rendering depends on the terminal's capabilities.

This bounded subset supports cursor movement, erasure, text attributes, scroll
regions, cursor save/restore and cursor visibility. It does not provide full
VT100 emulation: terminal queries, character-set selection, keypad modes and
VT52-mode switching are unsupported. Numeric lists are bounded; unknown SGR
attributes are ignored, and malformed extended-color groups do not partially
change rendition. Applications must restore any attributes, scroll region or
cursor visibility they change before exiting.

`ANSITST` shows positioning, reverse-video, erase and parser-reset checks with
two keypress pauses. `ANSITST /VER` prints
`BetterCP/M ANSITST 1.0 (Build 001)` without requiring a monitor.
Unload ANSI first, then the backend if it is no longer needed:
`RSX UNLOAD ANSI`, followed by `RSX UNLOAD M4SCRN` or `RSX UNLOAD ANSISCRN`.
With no other RSXs loaded, TPA returns to 53K. Startup does not automatically
choose ANSI.

The unchanged TE VT100 editor has passed an open/edit/save/exit test on cpmsim.
Its standard configuration needs an 80-column, 25-row host window, so that
configuration is not qualified for the 24-row Model 4. This does not imply full
VT100 emulation or compatibility with every application.

# Chapter 8 — Resident Extensions

One of BetterCP/M's most useful features is its ability to add commands and system services without rebuilding the operating system.

These additions are called **resident extensions**. Unlike ordinary transient programs, which are loaded when needed and normally disappear when they finish, resident extensions remain in memory and continue to provide their facilities while you work.

BetterCP/M supports two principal kinds of extensions: Command Processor Extensions (CPXs) and Resident System Extensions (RSXs).

This chapter explains how to use and manage them. You don't need to understand their internal workings to take advantage of the facilities they provide.

For complete command syntax and options, consult the CPX and RSX entries in Part II, *Command and Utility Reference*.

## 8.1 Introducing Resident Extensions

In conventional CP/M, the command processor provides a small collection of built-in commands. Most other commands are transient programs loaded from disk.

BetterCP/M extends this arrangement by allowing additional commands and services to remain resident.

For example, a resident extension might provide frequently used file-management commands, add a new operating-system service, or support a particular terminal.

Resident extensions offer several advantages.

A resident command is immediately available without loading a separate program from disk each time it is used. A resident service can remain available while different applications execute. Extensions can also be loaded and unloaded to suit the work you're doing.

There is a tradeoff, however: resident extensions occupy memory that would otherwise be available to transient programs.

BetterCP/M allows you to choose which optional extensions to keep loaded, making it possible to balance additional facilities against available program memory.

### Two Kinds of Extensions

BetterCP/M distinguishes between two principal types.

**Command Processor Extensions (CPXs)** add commands to the command environment. They are particularly useful for commands that you use frequently.

**Resident System Extensions (RSXs)** provide services that remain available while other programs execute. Terminal monitors and certain batch-processing facilities are examples.

Although both types remain resident, they serve different purposes and are managed separately.

## 8.2 Command Processor Extensions

A Command Processor Extension adds commands to BetterCP/M's command processor.

The standard BetterCP/M environment includes a resident command package named `RCP.CPX`.

This package provides familiar commands such as:

```text
DIR   ERA   TYPE   REN   USER
CLS   VER   COPY   MOVE
```

These commands can be executed without loading separate `.COM` programs.

For example:

```text
A>DIR
```

normally invokes the resident DIR command when the standard resident command package is installed.

### Resident and Transient Versions

Some BetterCP/M commands are available in both resident and transient forms.

The resident version generally provides commonly used operations, while the transient version may offer additional options.

For example, the transient DIR utility provides extended directory-display and file-search facilities.

BetterCP/M allows you to request a transient program explicitly by prefixing its name with a colon:

```text
A>:DIR /WHEREIS ED.COM
```

This bypasses the resident DIR command and executes `DIR.COM`.

A period can also be used as the prefix:

```text
A>.DIR /WHEREIS ED.COM
```

Both forms have the same meaning.

This is useful when a resident command and a transient utility share a name but provide different capabilities.

BetterCP/M 1.0 does not automatically switch to the transient version when you request an option supported only by that version. Instead, the resident command may tell you to invoke the transient utility explicitly.

For example:

```text
A>DIR /WHEREIS ED.COM
DIR: Use :DIR.
```

You can then enter:

```text
A>:DIR /WHEREIS ED.COM
```

For more information about resident and transient command execution, see Chapter 5.

### Additional CPXs

BetterCP/M is not limited to its standard resident command package.

Additional CPXs can be installed to provide other commands.

More than one CPX can be active at the same time. BetterCP/M maintains them in a defined order, which determines how their commands are considered when you enter a command name.

Ordinarily, you need not be concerned with that order unless two extensions provide commands with the same name.

The CPX command reference describes the available management operations.

## 8.3 Listing Installed CPXs

Before changing the resident command environment, it's useful to see which CPXs are currently configured.

Enter:

```text
A>CPX LIST
```

BetterCP/M displays information about the configured command processor extensions.

The list can help you identify which resident command packages are available and determine whether an optional extension is present.

An extension's appearance in the configured list does not necessarily mean it loaded successfully. If an extension could not be loaded, BetterCP/M may retain its configured entry while reporting a warning.

This distinction is useful when troubleshooting missing resident commands.

## 8.4 Loading and Unloading CPXs

BetterCP/M allows optional CPXs to be added to or removed from the active command environment.

### Loading a CPX

To load a command processor extension, use the CPX management command.

For example, an extension named `TOOLS.CPX` would be requested with:

```text
A>CPX LOAD TOOLS
```

The extension must be available in the appropriate location and must be compatible with the running BetterCP/M system.

Once successfully loaded, its commands become available through the normal command environment.

You can enter those commands just as you would any other BetterCP/M command.

### Unloading a CPX

To remove an optional CPX, use:

```text
A>CPX UNLOAD TOOLS
```

After the extension has been removed, its commands are no longer available as resident commands.

If corresponding transient programs are present, they may still be executed normally.

Unloading an optional CPX is useful when you no longer need its commands or want to change the resident command environment.

### A Note About Required Extensions

Not every resident component is necessarily optional.

Some facilities are part of the standard command environment or are required for the system to operate correctly.

BetterCP/M's extension-management facilities enforce the applicable restrictions.

If an extension cannot be removed, consult the reported message rather than attempting to bypass the restriction.

## 8.5 Resident System Extensions

Resident System Extensions provide services that remain available while other programs execute.

Unlike CPXs, which add commands to the command processor, RSXs extend the operating environment itself.

Terminal support is one of the most useful examples.

A program written for a particular terminal may expect certain control sequences to move the cursor, clear the screen, or change the display.

BetterCP/M can provide these facilities through resident terminal-monitor extensions.

Other RSXs provide facilities such as support for batch input or disk-format services.

### Listing RSXs

To examine the installed resident system extensions, enter:

```text
A>RSX LIST
```

BetterCP/M displays the currently installed RSXs.

This is useful when checking which services are available or determining whether an extension is still occupying memory.

### Loading an RSX

To load an RSX, use the RSX command.

For example:

```text
A>RSX LOAD ADM3A
```

requests the ADM-3A terminal personality.

Some RSXs depend on other extensions being loaded first.

Terminal personalities, for example, require a suitable screen backend. The backend provides the connection to the computer's display, while the terminal personality interprets the control sequences expected by applications.

The required loading order is described in Chapter 9.

### Unloading an RSX

To remove an RSX, enter:

```text
A>RSX UNLOAD ADM3A
```

BetterCP/M removes the extension when it can safely do so.

An extension that is still needed by another resident component cannot necessarily be unloaded immediately.

For example, a screen backend should not be removed while a terminal personality that depends on it remains active.

In such cases, unload the dependent extension first.

The RSX manager checks these relationships and reports operations that cannot be performed safely.

## 8.6 Extension Order and Memory Use

Resident extensions are loaded into memory and remain available until they are removed or the operating environment is reinitialized.

Because CP/M systems have limited memory, the number and size of loaded extensions can matter.

### Available Program Memory

Ordinary CP/M programs execute in the Transient Program Area, or TPA.

Resident extensions use memory that would otherwise be available to those programs.

Consequently, loading an extension can reduce the maximum size of a transient program that BetterCP/M can execute.

For example, you might load a terminal monitor to run a full-screen editor. While the monitor is active, less memory is available to the editor.

If you later want to run a particularly large program that doesn't require terminal emulation, you can unload the monitor and recover the memory it occupied.

This flexibility is one of the advantages of BetterCP/M's extension system.

### Choosing Which Extensions to Load

There's no particular advantage to loading every available extension simply because it exists.

Instead, consider which facilities you actually use.

Frequently used commands may be worth keeping resident.

A terminal monitor may be essential when running a particular application but unnecessary when using ordinary command-line utilities.

Specialized extensions can be loaded when needed and removed afterward.

### Extension Dependencies

Some extensions depend on other resident components.

For example, a terminal personality may require a particular screen backend.

These dependencies affect the order in which extensions must be loaded and unloaded.

In general, load the supporting component first, followed by the extension that uses it.

When removing them, reverse the order.

Chapter 9 provides examples involving terminal monitors.

## 8.7 Loading Extensions at Startup

If you regularly use the same resident extensions, you may prefer to load them automatically when BetterCP/M starts.

The standard BetterCP/M startup arrangement uses `STARTUP.SUB`, which is executed during a cold boot.

You can add extension-loading commands to this file.

For example, a system using an appropriate screen backend might include:

```text
RSX LOAD M4SCRN
RSX LOAD ADM3A
CLS
```

These commands load the screen backend, activate the ADM-3A terminal personality, and clear the display.

The example is appropriate only for systems supporting the named backend.

Other computers may require a different screen backend or terminal personality.

Before adding extension-loading commands to your startup file, test them individually at the command prompt.

Once you've confirmed that they work correctly, you can add them to `STARTUP.SUB`.

Chapter 7 explains how to configure the startup command.

## 8.8 Warm Boots and Extension Persistence

One of the distinguishing characteristics of BetterCP/M's resident extension system is that supported extensions remain available across ordinary warm boots.

In conventional CP/M, a warm boot returns control to the command environment after a program terminates.

BetterCP/M retains this behavior while preserving the resident extensions that are intended to survive.

For example, suppose you've loaded a terminal monitor and then started a full-screen editor.

When you leave the editor and return to the command prompt, the terminal monitor remains installed.

You can start another compatible application without loading the monitor again.

Similarly, command processor extensions remain available as the command environment is restored after transient programs finish.

A cold boot establishes a new operating session and loads the configured startup environment.

If you want a particular extension available after every cold boot, include the appropriate loading commands in your startup configuration.

## 8.9 Recovering from Extension Problems

Resident extensions are normally straightforward to manage, but occasionally an extension may be missing, damaged, incompatible, or incorrectly configured.

BetterCP/M provides safeguards intended to prevent an unusable optional extension from making the entire command environment unavailable.

### An Unusable CPX

If an optional CPX cannot be loaded or fails validation, BetterCP/M may display:

```text
CPX?
```

The system continues to the command prompt with the remaining usable extensions.

Commands supplied by the rejected CPX will not be available.

The extension may nevertheless remain in the configured list, so its appearance in `CPX LIST` does not necessarily indicate that it loaded successfully.

To remove an unusable optional extension, enter:

```text
A>CPX UNLOAD BAD
```

where `BAD` is the name of the affected extension.

Alternatively, replace the damaged extension file with a valid copy.

Until the problem is corrected, the warning may recur when BetterCP/M restores the command environment.

### An RSX Cannot Be Unloaded

If BetterCP/M refuses to unload an RSX, another extension may still depend on it.

For example, attempting to unload a screen backend while its terminal personality remains active can be rejected.

Unload the terminal personality first, then remove the backend.

### Insufficient Memory

If a transient program reports insufficient memory, examine the resident extensions currently loaded.

Some may no longer be needed.

Unloading unnecessary extensions can restore memory to the TPA.

### Recovering a Working Environment

If you've made experimental changes to your startup configuration and encounter problems after a cold boot, return to a known working configuration.

You may need to edit `STARTUP.SUB` to remove an unsuitable extension-loading command.

Keeping a backup system disk is particularly useful when experimenting with resident extensions or other system configuration facilities.
