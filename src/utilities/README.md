# BetterCP/M command utilities

This directory is the canonical home of commands maintained as part of the
BetterCP/M operating system.  Their executables are collected in
`build/utilities/` by running:

```sh
python3 tools/build_utilities.py
```

The collection currently contains:

| Family | Commands | Source |
|---|---|---|
| System configuration | `CONFIG`, `DUP` | `config.mac`, `dup.mac`, `disk/` |
| Extension management | `CPX`, `RSX` | `cpx.mac`, `rsx.mac` |
| Stock command replacements | `DIR`, `ERA`, `REN`, `TYPE`, `USER`, `CLS`, `SUBMIT`, `XSUB`; `SAVE` is resident in the CCP | this directory and `../cpx/rcp.mac` |
| System reporting | `STAT`, `VER` | `stat.mac` and `../cpx/rcp.mac` |
| Maintenance | `WARM` | `warm.mac` |

`PIP` is a planned BetterCP/M standard-utility replacement and will join this
collection when implemented.  `RSXTEST` and `RSX2TST` are development probes;
they are built with `RSX.COM` but are not release utilities.

Loadable extension modules are kept separately in `src/rsx/` and `src/cpx/`,
because they are not transient commands even when a `.COM` manager installs
them.

General CP/M utilities are intentionally maintained in the separate
[`CPMArchives/cpm-tools`](https://github.com/CPMArchives/cpm-tools) repository.
That project currently includes SYSINFO, DISKINFO, DPBCHK, FSCK, DISKEDIT,
COMINFO, and BDOSPROBE.  They target CP/M 2.2-compatible systems generally,
rather than BetterCP/M interfaces. BetterCP/M system disks include a pinned,
checksum-verified binary snapshot and its `TOOLS.DOC` manual. Their source,
tests, and release history remain in `cpm-tools`; they must not be forked into
this directory.


### Shared DU selection include

`common/duselect.inc` is the internal source library for Specification 208.
Its single/compound scope parser and bitmap iterator are qualified by
`tools/test_du_select.py`, with native assembler parity checked by
`tools/build_native_du_select.py`. STAT file inspection adopts bracketed selectors; DIR adoption remains pending. Callers supply the selection map and workspace described in the include.

## PATCH verified binary replacements

PATCH is built by `python3 tools/build_patch.py`; its self-contained native source
is `build/utilities/PATCH-NATIVE.MAC`. On CP/M, copy it as PATCH.MAC and run
`ZSM4 PATCH=PATCH`, then `LINK PATCH[A]`. The stock CP/M parity/execution runner is
`tools/build_native_patch.py`; compiled failure-injection tests are in
`tools/test_patch.py`. The controlling contract and current qualification limits
are in `docs/engineering/PATCH-Specification.md` and `PATCH-Implementation.md`.
Candidate Utilities packages put PATCH.COM/PATCH.TXT on the NOAH companion disk,
not the full primary disk. Model 4 qualification remains pending.
